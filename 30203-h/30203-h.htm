    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little more than a year ago I put forth a collection of articles under
      the title of <i>Flowers of Freethought</i>. The little volume met with a
      favorable reception, and I now issue a Second Series. By a "favorable
      reception" I only mean that the volume found purchasers, and, it is to be
      presumed, readers; which is, after all, the one thing a writer needs to
      regard as of any real importance. Certainly the volume was not praised,
      nor recommended, nor even noticed, in the public journals. The time is not
      yet ripe for the ordinary reviewers to so much as mention a book of that
      character. Not that I charge the said reviewers with being concerned in a
      deliberate conspiracy of silence against such productions. They have to
      earn their livings, and often very humbly, despite the autocratic airs
      they give themselves; they serve under editors, who serve under
      proprietors, who in turn consult the tastes, the intelligence, and the
      prejudices of their respective customers. And thus it is, I conceive, that
      thorough-going Freethought&mdash;at least if written in a popular style
      and published at a popular price&mdash;is generally treated with a
      silence, which, in some cases, is far from a symptom of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that my writing is sometimes objected to on grounds of "taste."
      But it is a curious thing that this objection has invariably been raised
      by one of two classes of persons:&mdash;either those who are hostile to my
      opinions, and therefore unlikely to be impartial judges in this respect;
      or those who, while sharing my opinions, are fond of temporising, and
      rather anxious to obtain the smiles&mdash;-not to say the rewards&mdash;of
      Orthodoxy. The advice of the one class is suspicious; that of the other is
      contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said in the former Preface, I refrain from personalities, which is
      all that can be demanded of a fair controversialist. There are sentences,
      and perhaps passages, in this volume, that some people will not like; but
      they are about things that <i>I</i> do not like. A propagandist should use
      his pen as a weapon rather than a fencing foil. At any rate, my style is
      my own; it is copied from no model, or set of models; although I confess
      to a predilection for the old forthright literature of England, before
      "fine writing" was invented, or "parliamentary" eloquence came into vogue,
      or writers were anxious to propitiate an imaginary critic at their elbows&mdash;the
      composite ghost, as it were, of all the ignoramuses, prigs, bigots, fools,
      and cowards on this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains to say that the articles in this volume are of the same
      general character as those in its predecessor. They were written at
      different intervals during the past ten or twelve years. I have not
      attempted to classify them. In several instances I have appended the date
      of first publication, as it seemed necessary, or at least convenient.

    <h2>
      LUSCIOUS PIETY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Tennyson's poem, <i>Locksley Hall: Sixty Years After</i>, is severe
      on what he evidently regards as the pornographic tendency of our age.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Feed the budding rose of boyhood with the drainage of your sewer;
     Send the drain into the fountain, lest the stream should issue pure.
     Set the maiden fancies wallowing in the troughs of Zolaism,&mdash;
     Forward, forward, ay and backward, downward too into the abysm."
</pre>
    <p>
      There is some truth in this, but far more exaggeration. English novels,
      however they may trifle and sentimentalise with the passion of love, are
      as a rule exceedingly "proper." For the most part, in fact, they
      deliberately ignore all the unconventional aspects of that passion, and
      you might read a thousand of their productions without suspecting, if you
      did not already know the fact, that it had any connexion with our physical
      nature. The men and women, youths and maidens, of Thackeray, Dickens, and
      George Eliot, to say nothing of minor writers, are true enough to nature
      in other respects, but in all sexual relations they are mere simulacri.
      George Meredith is our only novelist who triumphs in this region. As Mr.
      Lowell has noticed, there is a fine natural atmosphere of sex in his
      books. Without the obtrusion of physiology, which is out of place in art,
      his human beings are clearly divided into males and females, thinking,
      feeling and acting according to their sexual characteristics. Other
      novelists simply shirk the whole problem of sex, and are satisfied with
      calling their personages John or Mary as the one safe method of indicating
      to what gender they belong. This is how the English public is pleased to
      have it; in this manner it feeds the gross hypocrisy which is its constant
      bane. Hence the shock of surprise, and even of disgust, felt by the
      ordinary Englishman when he takes up a novel by a great French master of
      fiction, who thinks that Art, as well as Science, should deal frankly and
      courageously with every great problem of life. "Shocking!" cry the English
      when the veil of mystery is lifted. Yet the purism is only on the lips. We
      are not a whit more virtuous than those plain-spoken foreigners; for,
      after all, facts exist, however we blink them, and ignorance and innocence
      are entirely different things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great French masters of fiction do not write merely for boys and
      girls. They believe that other literature is required besides that which
      is fit for bread-and-butter misses. Yet they are not therefore vicious.
      They paint nature as it is, idealising without distorting, leaving the
      moral to convey itself, as it inevitably will. As James Thomson said, "Do
      you dread that the Satyr will be preferred to Hyperion, when both stand
      imaged in clear light before us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zolaism, or rather what Lord Tennyson means by the word&mdash;for <i>Nana</i>
      is a great and terrible book with all its vice&mdash;is not the chief
      danger to the morals of English youth. Long before the majority of them
      learn to read French with ease, there is a book put into the hands of all
      for indiscriminate reading. It is the Bible. In the pages of that book
      they find the lowest animal functions called by their vulgar names;
      frequent references, and sometimes very brutal ones, to the generative
      organs; and stories of lust, adultery, sodomy and incest, that might raise
      blushes in a brothel; while in the Song of Solomon they will find the most
      passionate eroticism, decked out with the most voluptuous imagery. The
      "Zolaism" of the Bible is far more pernicious than the "Zolaism" of French
      fiction. The one comes seductively, with an air of piety, and
      authoritatively, with an air of divinity; while the other shows that
      selfishness and excess lead to demoralisation and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in fact, and all history attests it, a close connexion between
      religion and sensuality. No student of human nature need be surprised at
      Louis XV. falling on his knees in prayer after debauching a young virgin
      in the <i>Parc aux Cerfs</i>. Nor is there anything abnormal in Count
      Cenci, in Shelley's play, soliciting God's aid in the pollution of his own
      daughter. It is said that American camp-meetings often wound up in a
      saturnalia. The Hallelujah lasses sing with especial fervor "Safe in the
      arms of Jesus." How many Christian maidens are moved by the promptings of
      their sexual nature when they adore the figure of their nearly naked
      Savior on a cross! The very nuns, who take vows of perpetual chastity,
      become spouses of Christ; and the hysterical fervor with which they
      frequently worship their divine bridegroom, shows that when Nature is
      thrust out of the door she comes in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catholic books of devotion for the use of women and young people are also
      full of thinly-veiled sensuality, and there are indications that this
      abomination is spreading in the "higher" religious circles in Protestant
      England, where the loathsome confessional is being introduced in other
      than Catholic churches. Paul Bert, in his <i>Morale des Jesuites</i>, gave
      a choice specimen of this class of literature, or rather such extracts as
      he dared publish in a volume bearing his honored name. It is a prayer in
      rhyme extending to eleven pages, and occurs in a book by Father Huguet,
      designed for "the dear daughters of Holy Mary." As Paul Bert says, "every
      mother would fling it away with horror if Arthur were substituted for
      Jesus." <i>Vive Jesus</i> is the constant refrain of this pious song. We
      give a sample or two in French with a literal English translation.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Vive Jesus, de qui l'amour Me va consumant unit et jour.
     Vive Jesus, vive sa force, Vive son agreable amore.
     Vive Jesus, quand il m'enivre D'un douceur qui me fait vivre.
     Vive Jesus, lorsque sa bouche D'un baiser amoureux me touche.
     Vive Jesus, grand il m'appelle Ma soeur, ma colombe, ma belle.
     Vive Jesus, quand sa bonte, Me reduit dans la nudite;
     Vive Jesns, quand ses blandices Me comblent de chastes delices.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Live Jesus, whose love consumes me night and night.&mdash;Live Jesus,
      live his force, live his agreeable attraction.&mdash;Live Jesus, when he
      intoxicates me with a sweetness that gives me life.&mdash;Live Jesus, when
      his mouth touches me with an amorous kiss.&mdash;Live Jesus, when he calls
      me, my sister, my dove, my lovely one.&mdash;Live Jesus, when his good
      pleasure reduces me to nudity; live Jesus, when his blandishments fill me
      with chaste delight."&mdash;And this erotic stuff is for the use of
      girls!!

    <h2>
      THE JEWISH SABBATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Edersheim's <i>Life of Jesus</i> contains some interesting appendices
      on Jewish beliefs and ceremonies. One of these deals with the Sabbath laws
      of the chosen people, and we propose to cull from it a few curious
      illustrations of Jewish superstitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mishnic tractate <i>Sabbath</i> stands at the head of twelve tractates
      on festivals. Another tractate treats of "commixtures," which are intended
      to make the Sabbath laws more bearable. The Jerusalem Talmud devotes 64
      folio columns, and the Babylon Talmud 156 double folio pages, to the
      serious discussion of the most minute and senseless regulations. It would
      be difficult to understand how any persons but maniacs or idiots could
      have concocted such elaborate imbecilities, if we did not remember that
      the priests of every religion have always bestowed their ability and
      leisure on matters of no earthly interest to anyone but themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling on the Sabbath was strictly forbidden, except for a distance of
      two thousand cubits (1,000 yards) from one's residence. Yet if a man
      deposited food for two meals on the Friday at the boundary of that
      "journey," the spot became his dwelling-place, and he might do another two
      thousand cubits, without incurring 'God's wrath. If a Jewish traveller
      arrived at a place just as the Sabbath commenced, he could only remove
      from his beasts of burden such objects as it was lawful to handle on the
      Lord's Day. He might also loosen their gear and let them tumble down of
      themselves, but stabling them was out of all question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rabbis exercised their ingenuity on what was the smallest weight that
      constituted "a burden." This was fixed at "a dried fig," but it was a moot
      point whether the law was violated if half a fig were carried at two
      different times on the same Sabbath. The standard measure for forbidden
      food was the size of an olive. If a man swallowed forbidden food of the
      size of half an olive, and vomited it, and then ate another piece of the
      same size, he would be guilty because his palate had tasted food to the
      prohibited degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing up an object, and catching it with the same hand was an undoubted
      sin; but it was a nice question whether he was guilty if he caught it
      with, the other hand. Rain water might be caught and carried away, but if
      the rain had run down from a wall the act was sinful. Overtaken by the
      Sabbath with fruit in his hand, stretched out from one "place" to another,
      the orthodox Jew would have to drop it, since shifting his full hand from
      one locality to another was carrying a burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be killed on the Sabbath, not even insects. Speaking of the
      Christian monks, Jortin says that "Some of them, out of mortification,
      would not catch or kill the vermin which devoured them; in which they far
      surpassed the Jews, who only spared them upon the Sabbath day." This
      interesting fact is supported by the authority of a Kabbi, who is quoted
      in Latin to the effect that cracking a flea and killing a camel are
      equally guilty. Dr. Edersheim evidently refers to the same authority in a
      footnote. On the whole this regulation against the killing of vermin must
      have been very irksome, and if the fleas were aware of it, they and the
      Jews must have had a lively time on the Sabbath. We cannot ascertain
      whether the prohibition extended to <i>scratching</i>. If it did, curses
      not loud but deep must have ascended to the throne of the Eternal; and if,
      as Jesus says, every idle word is written down in the great book of
      heaven, the recording angel must have had anything but a holiday on the
      day of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      No work was allowed on the Sabbath. Even roasting and baking had to be
      stopped directly the holy period began, unless a crust was already formed,
      in which case the cooking might be finished. Nothing was to be sent, even
      by a heathen, unless it would reach its destination before the Sabbath.
      Kabbi Gamaliel was careful to send his linen to the wash three days before
      the Sabbath, so as to avoid anything that might lead to Sabbath labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sabbath lamp was supposed to have been ordained on Mount Sinai. To
      extinguish it was a breach of the Sabbath law, but it might be put out
      from fear of Gentiles, robbers, or evil spirits, or in order that a person
      dangerously ill might go to sleep. Such concessions were obviously made by
      the Rabbis, as a means of accommodating their religious laws to the
      absolute necessities of secular life. They compensated themselves,
      however, by hinting that twofold guilt was incurred if, in blowing out one
      candle, its flame lit another.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Mosaic law, there was to be no fire on the Sabbath. Food
      might be kept warm, however, said the Rabbis, by wrapping it in
      non-conductors. The sin to be avoided was <i>increasing</i> the heat. Eggs
      might not be cooked, even in sand heated by the sun, nor might hot water
      be poured on cold. It was unlawful to put a vessel to catch the drops of
      oil that might fall from the lamp, but one might be put there to catch the
      sparks. Another concession to secular necessity! A father might also take
      his child in his arms, even if the child held a stone, although it was
      carrying things on the Sabbath; but this privilege was not yielded without
      a great deal of discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care should be taken that no article of apparel was taken off and carried.
      Fortunately Palestine is not a land of showers and sudden changes of
      temperature, or the Rabbis would have had to discuss the umbrella and
      overcoat question. Women were forbidden to wear necklaces, rings, or pins,
      on the Sabbath. Nose-rings are mentioned in the regulations, and the fact
      throws light on the social condition of the times. Women were also
      forbidden to look in the glass on the Sabbath, lest they should spy a
      white hair, and perform the sinful labor of pulling it out. Shoes might
      not be scraped with a knife, except perhaps with the back, but they might
      be touched up with oil or water. If a sandal tie broke on the Sabbath, the
      question of what should be done was so serious and profound that the
      Rabbis were never able to settle it. A plaster might be worn to keep a
      wound from getting worse, but not to make it better. False teeth were
      absolutely prohibited, for they might fall out, and replacing them
      involved labor. Elderly persons with a full artificial set must have cut a
      sorry figure on the Sabbath, plump-faced Mrs. Isaacs resolving herself
      periodically into a toothless hag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plucking a blade of grass was sinful. Spitting in a handkerchief was
      allowed by one Rabbi, but the whole tribe were at loggerheads about
      spitting on the ground. Cutting one's hair or nails was a mortal sin. In
      case of fire on the Sabbath, the utensils needed on that day might be
      saved, and as much clothes as was absolutely necessary. This severe
      regulation was modified by a fiction. A man might put on a dress, save it,
      go back and put on another, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Watering the
      cattle might be done by the Gentile, like lighting a lamp, the fiction
      being that he did it for himself and not for the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assistance might be given to an animal about to have young, or to a woman
      in childbirth&mdash;which are further concessions to property and
      humanity. All might be done on the Sabbath, too, needful for circumcision.
      On the other hand, bones might not be set, nor emetics given, nor any
      medical or surgical operation performed. Wine, oil, and bread might be
      borrowed, however, and one's upper garment left in pledge for it. No doubt
      it was found impossible to keep the Jews absolutely from pawnbroking even
      on the Sabbath, Another concession was made for the dead. Their bodies
      might be laid out, washed, and anointed. Priests of every creed are
      obliged to give way on such points, or life would become intolerable, and
      their victims would revolt in sheer despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature knew nothing of the Jewish laws, and hens had the perversity to lay
      eggs on the Sabbath. Such eggs were unlawful eating; yet if the hen had
      been kept, not for laying but for fattening, the egg might be eaten as a
      part of her economy that had accidentally fallen off!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the puerilities of the Sabbath Law among the Jews. The Old
      Testament is directly responsible for all of them. It laid down the basic
      principle, and the Rabbis simply developed it, with as much natural logic
      as a tree grows up from its roots. Our Sabbatarians of to-day are slaves
      to the ignorance and follies of the semi-barbarous inhabitants of ancient
      Palestine; men who believed that God had posteriors, and exhibited them;
      men who kept slaves and harems; men who were notorious for their
      superstition, their bigotry, and their fanaticism; men who believed that
      the infinite God rested after six days' work, and ordered all his
      creatures to regard the day on which he recruited his strength as holy.
      Surely it is time to fling aside their antiquated rubbish, and arrange our
      periods of rest and recreation according to the dictates of science and
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of a periodical day of rest from labor is simple and natural.
      It has everywhere been placed under the sanction of religion, but it arose
      from secular necessity. In the nomadic state, when men had little to do at
      ordinary times except watching their flocks and herds, the days passed in
      monotonous succession. Life was never laborious, and as human energies
      were not taxed there was no need for a period of recuperation, We may
      therefore rest assured that no Sabbatarian law was ever given by Moses to
      the Jews in the wilderness. Such a law first appears in a higher stage of
      civilisation. When nomadic tribes settle down to agriculture and are
      welded into nations, chiefly by defensive war against predatory
      barbarians; above all, when slavery is introduced and masses of men are
      compelled to build and manufacture; the ruling and propertied classes soon
      perceive that a day of rest is absolutely requisite. Without it the
      laborer wears out too rapidly&mdash;like the horse, the ox, or any other
      beast of burden. The day is therefore decreed for economic reasons. It is
      only placed under the sanction of religion because, in a certain stage of
      human development, there is no other sanction available. Every change in
      social organisation has then to be enforced as an edict of the gods. This
      is carried out by the priests, who have unquestioned authority over the
      multitude, and who, so long as their own privileges and emoluments are
      secured, are always ready to guard the interest of the temporal powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the origin of the day of rest in Egypt, Assyria, and elsewhere.
      But it was lost sight of in the course of time, even by the ruling classes
      themselves; and the theological fiction of a divine ordinance became the
      universally accepted explanation. This fiction is still current in
      Christendom. We are gravely asked to believe that men would work
      themselves to death, and civilised nations commit economical suicide, if
      they were not taught that a day of rest was commanded by Jehovah amidst
      the lightnings and thunders of Sinai. In the same way, we are asked to
      believe that theft and murder would be popular pastimes without the
      restraints of the supernatural decalogue fabled to have been received by
      Moses. As a matter of fact, the law against theft arose because men object
      to be robbed, and the law against murder because they object to be
      assassinated. Superstition does not invent social laws; it merely throws
      around them the glamor of a supernatural authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests have a manifest interest in maintaining this glamor. Accordingly
      we find that Nonconformists as well as Churchmen claim the day of rest as
      the Lord's Day&mdash;although its very name of Sunday betrays its Pagan
      origin. It is not merely a day of rest, they tell us; it is also a day of
      devotion. Labor is to be laid aside in order that the people may worship
      God. The physical benefit of the institution is not denied; on the
      contrary, now that Democracy is decisively triumphing, the people are
      assured that Sunday can only be maintained under a religious sanction. In
      other words, religion and priests are as indispensable as ever to the
      welfare of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theological fiction should be peremptorily dismissed. Whatever
      service it once rendered has been counterbalanced by its mischiefs. The
      rude laborer of former times&mdash;the slave or the serf&mdash;only wanted
      rest from toil. He had no conception of anything higher. But circumstances
      have changed. The laborer of to-day aspires to share in the highest
      blessings of civilisation. His hours of daily work are shortened. The rest
      he requires he can obtain in bed. What he needs on Sunday is not <i>rest</i>,
      but <i>change</i>; true re-creation of his nature; and this is denied him
      by the laws that are based upon the very theological fiction which is
      pretended to be his most faithful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The working classes at present are simply humbugged by the Churches. The
      day of rest is secure enough without lies or fictions. What the masses
      want is an opportunity to make use of it. Now this cannot be done if all
      rest on the same day. A minority must work on Sunday, and take their rest
      on some other day of the week. And really, when the nonsensical solemnity
      of Sunday is gone, any other day would be equally eligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parsons work on Sunday; so do their servants, and all who are engaged
      about their gospel-shops. Why should it be so hard then for a railway
      servant, a museum attendant, an art-gallery curator, or a librarian to
      work on Sunday? Let them rest some other day of the week as the parson
      does. They would be happy if they could have his "off days" even at the
      price of "Sunday labor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Churches and chapels do not attract so many people as they did. There is
      every reason why priestly Protective laws should be broken down. It is a
      poor alternative to offer a working man&mdash;the church or the
      public-house; and they are now trying to shut the public-house and make it
      church or nothing. Other people should be consulted as well as mystery-men
      and their followers. Let us have freedom. Let the dwellers in crowded city
      streets, who work all day in close factories, be taken at cheap rates to
      the country or the seaside. Let them see the grand sweep of the sky. Let
      them feel the spring of the turf under their feet. Let them look out over
      the sea&mdash;the highway between continents&mdash;-and take something of
      its power and poetry into their blood and brain. During the winter, or in
      summer if they feel inclined, let them visit the institutions of culture,
      behold the beautiful works of dead artists, study the relics of dead
      generations, feel the links that bind the past to the present, and imagine
      the links that will bind the present to the future. Let their pulses be
      stirred with noble music. Let the Sunday be their great day of freedom,
      culture, and humanity. As "God's Day" it is wasted. We must rescue it from
      the priests and make it "Man's Day."

    <h2>
      PROFESSOR STOKES ON IMMORTALITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The orthodox world makes much of Sir G. G. Stokes, baronet, M.P., and
      President of the Royal Society. It is so grateful to find a scientific man
      who is naively a Christian. Many of the species are avowed, or, at any
      rate, strongly suspected unbelievers; while others, who make a profession
      of Christianity, are careful to explain that they hold it with certain
      reservations, being Christians in general, but not Christians in
      particular. Sir G. G. Stokes, however, is as orthodox as any conventicle
      could desire. Perhaps it was for this reason that he was selected to
      deliver one of the courses of Gilford Lectures. He would be a sort of
      set-off against the rationalism of Max Muller and the scepticism of Tylor.
      What other reason, indeed, could have inspired his selection? He has not
      the slightest reputation as a theologian or philosopher, and one of the
      leading reviews, in noticing his Clifford Lectures, expresses a mild but
      decided wonder at his appearing in such a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the Gifford Lectures, however, pass&mdash;for the present. We propose
      to deal with an earlier effort of Sir G. G. Stokes. Nearly two years ago
      he delivered a lecture at the Finsbury Polytechnic on the Immortality of
      the Soul. It was reported in the <i>Family Churchman</i>, and reprinted
      after revision as a twopenny pamphlet, with the first title of "I." This
      is the only pointed thing about it. The lecture is about "I," or, as Sir
      G. G. Stokes, might say, "All my I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir G. G. Stokes begins by promising to confine himself to the question,
      "What is it that personal identity depends upon and consists in?" But he
      does not fulfil the promise. After some jejune remarks upon this question
      he drops into theology and winds up with a little sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot pretend that I am able to answer that question myself," says Sir
      G. G. Stokes. Why, then, did he not leave it alone? "But I will endeavor,"
      he says, "to place before you some thoughts bearing in that direction
      which I have found helpful to myself, and which possibly may be of some
      help to some of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir G. G. Stokes does not mention David Hume, but that great thinker
      pointed out, with his habitual force and clearness, that personal identity
      depends upon memory. Our scientific lecturer, with the theological twist,
      says it "involves memory," which implies a certain reservation. Yet he
      abstains from elucidating the point; and as it is the most important one
      in the discussion, he must be held guilty of short-sightedness or
      timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory involves thought, says Sir G. G. Stokes. This is true; in fact, it
      is a truism. And what, he asks, does thought depend on? "To a certain
      extent" he allows that it "depends upon the condition of the brain." But
      during the present life, at any rate, it depends <i>absolutely</i> on the
      condition of the brain Look at the head of an idiot, and then at the head
      of Shakespeare; is not the brain difference the obvious cause of the
      mental difference? Are there not diseases of the brain that affect thought
      in a definite manner? Is not thought excited by stimulants, and deadened
      or even annihilated by narcotics? Is it not entirely suspended in healthy
      sleep? Will not a man of genius become an imbecile if his brain softens?
      Will not a philosopher rave like a drunken fishfag if he suffers from
      brain inflammation? Is not thought most vigorous when the brain is mature?
      And is it not weakest in the first and second childishness of youth and
      old age?
    </p>
    <p>
      The dependence of thought on the brain is so obvious, it is so
      demonstrable by the logical methods of difference and concomitant
      variations, that whoever disputes it, or only allows it "to a certain
      extent," is bound to assign another definite cause. A <i>definite</i>
      cause, we say; not a fanciful or speculative one, which is perfectly
      hypothetical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir G. G. Stokes does not do this. He tries to make good his reservation
      by a negative criticism of "the materialistic hypothesis." He takes the
      case of a man who, while going up a ladder and speaking, was knocked on
      the head by a falling brickbat. For two days he was unconscious, and "when
      he came to, he completed the sentence that he had been speaking when he
      was struck." Now, at first sight, this seems a strong confirmation of "the
      materialistic hypothesis." A shock to the brain stopped its action and
      suspended consciousness. Automatic animal functions went on, but there was
      no perception, thought, or feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the effects of the shock wore off the brain resumed its action, and
      began at the very point where it left off. But this last circumstance is
      seized by Sir G. G. Stokes as "a difficulty." <i>Some</i> change must have
      gone on, he says, during the two days the man lay unconscious; there must
      have been <i>some</i> waste of tissues, <i>some</i> change in the brain;
      yet "there is no trace of this change in the joining together of the
      thought after the interval of unconsciousness with the thought before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our reply is a simple one. In the first place, Sir G. G. Stokes is making
      much of a single fact, which he has not weighed, in despite of a host of
      other facts, not in the least questionable, and all pointing in one
      direction. In the second place, he does not tell us <i>what</i> change
      went on in the man's brain. May it not have been, at least with respect to
      the cerebrum, quite infinitesimal? In the third place, Sir G. G. Stokes
      should be aware that all brain changes do not affect consciousness, even
      in the normal state. Lastly, consciousness depends upon perception; and if
      all the avenues of sensation were closed, and the alteration of brain
      tissues were exceedingly slight (as it would be if the brain were not
      working), it is nothing very extraordinary that the man should resume
      thought and volition at the point where they ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second "difficulty" raised, rather than discovered, by Sir G. G.
      Stokes is this. "I am conscious of a power which I call will," he says,
      "and when I hold up my hand I can choose whether I shall move it to the
      right or to the left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, according to the materialistic hypothesis, everything about me is
      determined simply by the ponderable molecules which constitute my body
      acting simply and solely according to the very same laws according to
      which matter destitute of life might act. Well then, if we follow up this
      supposition to its full extent, we are obliged to suppose that, whether I
      move at this particular moment of time&mdash;4.25, on the 30th of March&mdash;my
      hand to the right or to the left, was determined by something inevitable,
      something which could not have been otherwise, and must have come down, in
      fact, from my ancestors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Sir G. G. Stokes "confesses" that this seems to him to "fly completely
      in the face of common sense." And so it does, if by "determined" he means
      that <i>somebody</i> settled the whole business, down to the minutest
      details, a thousand, a million, or a thousand million years ago. But if
      "determined" simply means that every phenomenon is <i>caused</i>, in the
      philosophical&mdash;not the theological or metaphysical&mdash;meaning of
      the word, it does not fly in the face of common sense at all. Little as
      Sir G. G. Stokes may like it, he <i>does</i>&mdash;body and brain, thought
      and feeling, volition and taste&mdash;come down from his ancestors. That
      is the reason why he is an Englishman, a Whig, a bit of a Philistine, an
      orthodox Christian, and a very indifferent reasoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, does not this objection come with an ill grace from a Christian
      Theist? Has Sir G. G. Stokes never read St. Paul? Has he never heard of
      John Calvin and Martin Luther? Has he never read the Thirty-nine Articles
      of his own Church? All those authorities teach predestination; which,
      indeed, logically follows the doctrine of an all-wise and all-powerful
      God. Yet here is Sir G. G. Stokes, a Church of England man, objecting to
      the "materialistic hypothesis" on the ground that it makes things
      "determined."
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Stokes next refers to "something about us" which we call "will."
      This he proceeds to treat as an independent force like magnetism or
      electricity. What he says about it shows him to be a perfect tyro in
      psychology. At the end of the section he exclaims, "So much for that
      theory"&mdash;the materialistic hypothesis; and we are tempted to exclaim,
      "So much for Sir G. G. Stokes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes the "psychic theory," according to which "man consists of body
      and soul." Here the Professor shows a lucid interval. He points out that
      if the soul is really hampered by the body, it is strange that a blow on a
      man's head should "retard the action of his thoughts." He also remarks
      that, according to this theory, the "blow has only got to be somewhat
      harder till the head is smashed altogether, and the man is killed, and
      then the thoughts are rendered more active than ever." Which, as our old
      friend Euclid observes, is absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Stokes dismisses the "body and soul" theory as "open to very
      grave objections." He admits that it is held by "many persons belonging to
      the religious world," nevertheless he does not think it can be "deduced
      from Scripture," to which he goes on to appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we beg our Christian friends to notice this. Here is the great Sir G.
      Gr. Stokes they make so much of actually throwing up the sponge. Instead
      of showing <i>scientifically</i> that man has a soul, and thus cheering
      their drooping spirits, he leaves the platform, mounts the pulpit, and
      plays the part of a theologian. In fact he can tell them no more than the
      ordinary parson who sticks his nose between the pages of his Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the Scripture, it will afford very little comfort to the
      Christians to know that Professor Stokes does not believe that it teaches
      the immortality of the soul. He supports this view by citing the authority
      of the present Bishop of Durham and "another bishop," who regard the
      doctrine of an immortal soul as no part of a Christian faith. Had Sir G.
      G. Stokes been better read in the literature of his own Church, he might
      have adduced a number of other divines, including Bishop Courtenay and
      Archbishop Whately, who took the same position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do we learn from Scripture?" inquires Professor Stokes. And
      this is his answer. "In scripture," he says, "man is spoken of as
      consisting of body, soul, and spirit." And in Sir G. G. Stokes's opinion
      it is the third article which "lies at the very basis of life." It is <i>spirit</i>,
      "the interaction of which with the material organism produced a living
      being" in the Garden of Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we pause to interject a reflection. Ordinary Christians believe in
      body and soul; Professor Stokes believes in body, soul, and spirit. That
      is, he says man is made up of three instead of two. But in step our
      Theosophic friends, who pile on four more, and tell us that man is
      sevenfold. Now who is right! According to their own account they are <i>all</i>
      right. But this is impossible. In our opinion they are all <i>wrong</i>.
      Their theories are imaginary. All they <i>know</i> anything of is the
      human body.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Professor Stokes's excursion in the region of Biblical
      exegesis. Never have we met with anything more puerile and absurd. He
      finds "soul" and "spirit" in the English Bible, and he supposes them to be
      different things. He even builds up a fanciful theory on the fact that the
      expression "living soul" occurs in the New Testament, but he does not
      remember the expression "living spirit." Hence he concludes that <i>spirit</i>
      is not "living" but "life-making."
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and Professor Stokes is a
      capital illustration of this truth. We get "soul" and "spirit" in the New
      Testament, as well as in the Old, simply because both words are used
      indifferently by the English translators. This is owing to the composite
      character of the English language. One word comes from the Greek, the
      other from the Latin, and both mean exactly the same thing. The Hebrew <i>ruach</i>,
      the (Greek <i>pneuma</i>), and the Latin <i>spiritus</i>, all originally
      meant <i>the breath</i>; and as breathing was the most obvious function of
      life, persisting even in the deepest sleep, it came to signify <i>life</i>,
      when that general conception was reached; and when the idea of soul or
      spirit was reached, the same word was used to denote it. All this is shown
      clearly enough by Tylor, and is corroborated by the more orthodox Max
      Muller; so that Professor Stokes has fallen into a quagmire, made of the
      dirt of ignorance and a little water of knowledge, and has made himself a
      laughing-stock to everyone who possesses a decent acquaintance with the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever it is that Professor Stokes thinks a man has apart from his body,
      he does not believe it to be immortal. The immortality of the soul and a
      future life, he says, are "two totally different things." The one he
      thinks "incorrect," the other he regards as guaranteed by Scripture; in
      other words, by Paul, who begins his exposition by exclaiming "Thou fool!"
      and ends it by showing his own folly. The apostle's nonsense about the
      seed that cannot quicken unless it die, was laughed at by the African
      chief in Sir Samuel Baker's narrative. The unsophisticated negro said that
      if the seed did die it would never come to anything. And he was right, and
      Paul was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      There <i>is</i> a resurrection, however, for Paul says so, and his
      teaching is inspired, though his logic is faulty. Men will rise from the
      dead <i>somehow</i>, and with "a body of some kind." Not the body we have
      now. Oh dear no! Great men have thought so, but it is an "incredible
      supposition." Being a chemist, Sir G. G. Stokes sees the ineffable
      absurdity, the physical and logical impossibility, of this orthodox
      conception, which was taught by Mr. Spurgeon without the slightest
      misgiving, and upheld by the teaching of the Church of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is it that <i>will</i> rise from the dead, and get joined with
      some sort of inconceivable body? We have shown that Professor Stokes's
      distinction between "soul" and "spirit" is fanciful. It will not do for
      him, then, to say it is the "spirit" that will rise, for he denies, or
      does not believe, the renewed life of the "soul." Here he leaves us
      totally in the dark. Perhaps what will rise is "a sort of a something"
      that will get joined to "a sort of a body" and live in "a sort of a
      somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What," asks Professor Stokes, "is man's condition between death and the
      resurrection?" He admits that the teaching of Scripture on this point is
      "exceedingly meagre." He inclines to think that "the intermediate state is
      one of unconsciousness," something like when we faint, and thus, as there
      will be no perceptions in the interval, though it be millions of years, we
      shall, "when we breathe our last," be brought "immediately face to face
      with our final account to receive our final destiny." And if our final
      destiny depends in any way on how we have used our reasoning powers,
      Professor Stokes will be consigned to a warm corner in an excessively
      high-temperatured establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Professor Stokes admits that all he has said, or can say, gives
      no "evidence" of a future life. What <i>is</i> the evidence then? "Well,"
      he says, "the great evidence which we as Christians accept is, that there
      is One Who has passed already before us from the one state of being to the
      other." The resurrection of Jesus Christ, he tells us, is "an historical
      event," and is supported by an enormous amount of most weighty evidence.
      But he does not give us a single ounce of it. The only argument he has for
      a future state is advanced on the last page, and he retires at the moment
      he has an opportunity of proving his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Stokes says: "I fear I have occupied your time too long. We fear
      so too." "These are dark subjects," he adds. True, and he has not
      illuminated them. There is positively no evidence of a future life. The
      belief is a conjecture, and we must die to prove or disprove it.

    <h2>
      PAUL BERT *
    </h2>
    <p>
      Victor Hugo and Gambetta have their places in the Pantheon of history, and
      Death is beginning his harvest among the second rank of the founders of
      the present French Republic, Every one of these men was an earnest
      Freethinker as well as a staunch Republican. Paul Bert, who has just died
      at Tonquin at the post of duty, was one of the band of patriots who
      gathered round Gambetta in his Titanic organisation of the National
      Defence; a band from which has come most of those who have since been
      distinguished in the public life of France. After the close of the war,
      Paul Bert became a member of the National Assembly, in which he has held
      his seat through all political changes. As a man of science he was eminent
      and far-shining, being not a mere <i>doctrinaire</i> but a practical
      experimentalist whose researches were of the highest interest and
      importance. His <i>Manual of Elementary Science</i>, which has been
      recently translated into English, is in use in nearly every French school,
      and there is no other volume of the kind that can be compared with it for
      a moment. As a friend and promoter of general education, Paul Bert was
      without a rival. He strove in season and out of season to raise the
      standard of instruction, to elevate the status of teachers, and to free
      them from the galling tyranny of priests. It is not too much to say that
      Paul Bert was the idol of nine-tenths of the schoolmasters and
      schoolmistresses in the French rural districts, where the evils he helped
      to remove had been most rampant.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * November 21, 1886.
</pre>
    <p>
      This distinguished Frenchman is now dead at the comparatively early age of
      fifty-three. Although his illness was so serious, the French premier
      telegraphed that it would be impolitic for the Resident General to leave
      Tonquin suddenly. Thereupon Paul Bert replied, "You are right; it is
      better to die at my post than for me to quit Tonquin at the present
      moment." That dispatch was the last he was able to send himself.
      Subsequent dispatches came, from other hands, and at last the news arrived
      that Paul Bert was dead. The French premier announced the fact from the
      Tribune in a broken voice and amid profound silence. "The Chamber loses in
      him," said M. de Freycinet, "one of its eminent members, science an
      illustrious representative, France one of her most devoted children." The
      next day the Chamber, by an overwhelming majority, voted a State funeral
      and a pension of £400 a year to Mdme. Bert, with reversion to her
      children. The first vote was strenuously opposed by Monseigneur Freppel,
      Bishop of Angers, on the ground that the deceased was an inveterate enemy
      of religion, but the bishop was ignominiously defeated by 379 votes
      against 45. That is probably a fair test of the relative strength of
      Freethought and Christianity among educated men in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monseigneur Freppel was right Paul Bert was an inveterate enemy of
      religion. He was a militant Atheist, who believed that the highest service
      you can render to mankind is to free them from superstition. No wonder the
      Church hated him. At a famous banquet he proposed the toast, "The
      eradication of the two phylloxeras&mdash;the phylloxera of the vine and
      the phylloxera of the Church." His handbook on the Morality of the Jesuits
      was a frightful exposure of the duplicity and rascality of priestcraft.
      About twelve months before Grambetta's death, that great statesman took
      the chair at one of Paul Bert's atheistical lectures. It was a bold thing
      to do, but Gambetta was a bold man. The great statesman did a bolder thing
      still when he took office. He scandalised the Christian world by
      appointing his atheistic friend Paul Bert as Minister of Public
      Instruction and Public Worship. Surely this was a piece of irony worthy
      the assiduous student of Rabelais and Voltaire. "Clericalism is the
      enemy," said Gambetta. Paul Bert accepted the battle-cry, but he did not
      content himself with shouting. He labored to place education on a basis
      which would make it a citadel of Freethought. The Tory <i>Standard</i>
      allows that he "laid the bases of military education in the schools and <i>lycees</i>"
      that he "first dispensed the pupils in State educational establishments
      from the obligation of attending any religious service, or belonging to
      any class in which religious instruction was given," and that he first
      organised the higher education of girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Bert was a typical Frenchman and an illustrious Atheist. What do the
      clergy make of this phenomenon? Here is a man, trained by his father to
      hate priests, brought up from his cradle in an atmosphere of Freethought,
      and owing nothing to the Church; yet he becomes an eminent scientist, a
      fervid patriot, an educational reformer, a leading statesman, a tender
      husband and father, and a warm friend of the best men, of his time; and on
      his decease the State gives him a public funeral and provides for his
      widow and children. The man, we repeat, was an open, nay a militant
      Atheist; and again we ask, What do the clergy make of this phenomenon?
    </p>
    <p>
      During his lifetime Darwin was the <i>bete noir</i> of the clergy. They
      hated him with a perfect and very natural hatred, for his scientific
      doctrines were revolutionary, and if he was right they and their Bible
      were certainly wrong. The Black Army denounced his impious teachings from
      thousands of pulpits. With some of them he was the Great Beast, with
      others Antichrist himself. And they were all the madder because he never
      took the slightest notice of them, but treated them with the silent
      contempt which a master of the hounds bestows on the village curs who bark
      at his horse's heels. Yet, strange to say, when Darwin died, instead of
      being buried in some quiet Kentish cemetery or churchyard, he was actually
      sepulchred in Westminster Abbey. Having fought the living Darwin tooth and
      nail, the clergy quietly appropriated the dead Darwin. The living,
      thinking and working man was a damnable heretic, hated of God and his
      priests, but his corpse was a very good Christian, and it was buried in a
      temple of the very faith he had undermined. Darwin, with all his gravity,
      is said to have loved a joke, and really this was so good a joke that he
      might almost have grinned at it in his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and bye, the great naturalist may figure as an ardent devotee of the
      creed he rejected. The clergy are hypocritical and base enough&mdash;as a
      body we mean&mdash;to claim Darwin himself now they have secured his
      corpse. Who knows that, in another twenty years, the verger or even the
      Dean of Westminster Abbey, in showing visitors through the place, may not
      say before a certain tomb, "Here is the last resting-place of that eminent
      Christian, Charles Darwin. There was a little misunderstanding between him
      and the clergy while he lived, but it has all passed away like a mist, and
      he is now accounted one of the chief pillars of the Church"?
    </p>
    <p>
      What the clergy have done in the concrete with Darwin they have done in
      the abstract with his predecessors in the great struggle between light and
      darkness. What are all the lying stories about Infidel Death-Beds but
      conversions of corpses? Great heretics, whose scepticism was unshaken in
      their lifetime by all the parson-power of the age, were easily converted
      in their tombs. What the clergy said about them was true, or why didn't
      they get up and contradict? All the world over silence gives consent, and
      if the dead man did not enter a <i>caveat</i>, who could complain if the
      men of God declared that he finished up in their faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently the clergy have been converting another corpse, but this time it
      has been able to protest by proxy, and the swindle has been exposed all
      along the line. Paul Bert, the great French Freethinker, died at Tonquin.
      The nation voted him a state funeral, and his body was shipped to France.
      The voyage was a long one, and it gave the pious an opportunity of
      leisurely converting the corpse, especially as Paul Bert's family were all
      on board the steamer. Accordingly a report, which we printed and commented
      on at the time, appeared in all the papers that the atheistic Resident
      General had sent for a Catholic bishop on his death-bed and taken the
      sacrament. Thousands of Christians believed the story at once, the wish
      being father to the thought. They never stopped to inquire whether the
      report was true. Why indeed should they? They took the whole of their
      religion on trust, and of course they could easily dispense with proof in
      so small a matter as an infidel's conversion. Some of them were quite
      hilarious. "Ha," they exclaimed, "what do you Freethinkers say now?" And
      with the childish simplicity of their kind, when they were told that the
      story was in all probability false, they replied, "Why, isn't it in
      print?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the fraud is exposed very few of the journals that printed it
      will publish the contradiction. We may be sure that the story of Paul
      Bert's conversion will be devoutly believed by thousands of Christians,
      and will probably be worked up in pious tracts for the spiritual
      edification of superstitious sheep. Give a lie a day's start, said
      Cobbett, and it is half round the world before you can overtake it. Give
      it a week's start, and if it happens to be a lie that suits the popular
      taste, you may give up all hope of overtaking it at all. First in the way
      of exposure was a telegram from the Papal Nuncio at Lisbon on December 29,
      saying that his name had been improperly used. He was not the author of
      the telegram that had been fathered on him, and he knew nothing of Paul
      Bert's conversion. A day or two later the ship conveying the heretic's
      corpse arrived at the Suez Canal. Madame Bert heard of the preposterous
      story of her husband's conversion, and she immediately telegraphed that it
      was absolutely and entirely false. Madame Bert, who is a highly
      accomplished woman, is a Freethinker herself, and she is too proud of her
      husband's reputation to lose a moment in contradicting a miserable libel
      on his courage and sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dropping the pen, we take the opportunity of saying a few words on
      Madame Adam's article on Paul Bert in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>. She
      is an able woman, but not a philosopher, and she labors under the craze of
      thinking that she is a great force in European politics. She confesses
      that she hated Paul Bert, and she betrays that her aversion originated in
      pique and jealousy. We do not wish to be ungallant, but Gambetta had good
      reasons for preferring Paul Bert to Juliette Lambert, although the lady is
      ludicrously wrong in saying that "it was to Paul Bert that Gambetta owed
      all the formulae of his scientific politics." She forgets that Gambetta's
      speeches before Paul Bert became his friend are in print. She also ignores
      the fact that Gambetta was a stedfast Freethinker from his college days,
      and was never infected with that sentimental religiosity from which she
      assumes that Paul Bert perverted him. Certainly he was incapable of being
      moved by the hackneyed platitudes about science and religion that form the
      prelude of Madame Adam's article, and seem borrowed from one of M. Oaro's
      lectures. Nor did he need Paul Bert to tell him, after the terrible
      struggle of 1877, that Clericalism was the enemy. Still less, if that were
      possible, did he require Paul Bert or any other man to tell him that
      France imperatively needed education free from priestcraft. Madame Adam is
      so anxious to deal Paul Bert a stab in the dark that she confuses the most
      obvious facts. Gambetta and he fought against clericalism, and labored for
      secular education, because they were both Freethinkers as well as
      Republicans. In venting her spite, and reciting her own witticisms, she
      fails to see the force of her own admissions. This is what she writes of a
      very momentous occasion:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Gambetta at Saint Cloud the Sunday after the mishap at Obaronne. He
      had just been taking the chair at the Chateau d'Eau, at an anti-clerical
      meeting of Paul Bert's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came in a little late to dinner. Some dozen of us were already
      assembled on a flight of steps at the bottom of the garden when he
      appeared. He spied me at once [a woman speaks!] across the green lawn and
      a vase of tall fuchsias, and called out in his sonorous voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Admirable! superb! extraordinary! Never since Voltaire has such an
      irrefutable indictment been brought against the clergy! And what a style!
      What consummate art!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And what bad policy!' said a great banker who was with us, in a low
      voice, to me [note the me].
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gambetta went on as he approached us:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And such an immense success&mdash;beyond anything that could be
      imagined! Ten thousand enthusiastic cheers!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The ten thousand and first would not have come from me,' I said [said
      I], as we greeted one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You yourself,' cried Gambetta, 'you yourself, I tell you, would have
      been carried away; if not by the ideas, by the genius lavished in
      propounding them.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and notwithstanding Madame Adam's "religion" and the great banker's
      "policy," Gambetta and Paul Bert were in the right, and miles above their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Madame Adam's lively nonsense, the <i>Echo</i> says that Paul
      Bert tried to set up another Inquisition. "In France," says this organ of
      Christian Radicalism, "they strive to prevent a parent from giving his
      child a religious education." They do nothing of the kind. They simply
      insist that the religious education shall not be given in the national
      school. Every French parent is free to give religious instruction to his
      children at home, and there are still thousands of State priests who can
      supply his deficiencies in that respect. Meanwhile national education
      progresses in good earnest. The Empire left nearly half the population
      unable to write their names. Now the Republic educates every boy and girl,
      and Mr. Matthew Arnold assures us that the French schools are among the
      best in Europe, while the sale of good books is prodigious. Gambetta and
      Paul Bert worked, fought, and sacrificed for this, and they cannot be
      robbed of the glory.

    <h2>
      BRADLAUGH'S GHOST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Directly after Charles Bradlaugh's death we expressed a belief that the
      Christians would concoct stories about him as soon as it was safe to do
      so. It took some time to concoct and circulate the pious narratives of the
      deathbeds of Voltaire and Thomas Paine, and a proper interval is necessary
      in the case of the great Iconoclast. Already, however, the more
      superstitious and fanatical Christians are shaking their heads and
      muttering that "Bradlaugh must have said something when he was dying, only
      they wouldn't allow believers in his sick room to hear it." By and bye the
      more cunning and unscrupulous will come to the aid of their weaker
      brethren, and a circumstantial story will be circulated in Sunday-schools
      and Christian meetings.

      We are well aware that his daughter took every precaution. She has the
      signed testimony of the nurses, that her father never spoke on the subject
      of religion during his last illness. But this may not avail, for similar
      precautions are admitted to have been taken in the cases of Voltaire and
      Paine, and, in despite of this, the Christian traducers have forged the
      testimony of imaginary interlopers, whose word cannot be disproved, as
      they never existed outside the creative fancy of these liars for the glory
      of God.

      It is quite a superstition that truth is always a match for falsehood.
      George Eliot remarked that the human mind takes absurdity as asses chew
      thistles. We add that it swallows falsehood as a cat laps milk. It was
      humorously said the other day by Colonel Ingersoll that "The truth is the
      weakest thing in the world. It always comes into the arena naked, and
      there it meets a healthy young lie in complete armor, and the result is
      that the truth gets licked. One good, solid lie will knock out a hundred
      truths." It has done so with respect to the death of Voltaire and Paine,
      and it will do so with respect to the death of Charles Bradlaugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Spiritualists are having an innings. Charles Bradlaugh was
      buried by his friends at Woking, but his ghost is said to have turned up
      at Birmingham. It appears from a report in the <i>Medium and Daybreak</i>
      that Mr. Charles Gray, of 139 Pershore-road, being "sadly sorrow-stricken
      by the passing away of a son," was "constrained to remain at home" on the
      evening of May 31. A seance was arranged "with a few friends," and of
      course a message was received from the dear departed boy. This was
      conveyed through Mr. Russell, junior, whose age is not stated. Then Mr.
      Reedman "was controlled to write by C. Bradlaugh." Mr. Reedman wrote "in a
      perfectly unconscious state, and on the departure of the influence was
      much surprised on being told of the nature of the communication."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reedman's surprise may have been great, but it scarcely equals our
      own. One would imagine that if Charles Bradlaugh still lived, and were
      able to communicate with people in this world, he would speak to his
      beloved daughter, and to the friends who loved him with a deathless
      affection. Why should he go all the way to Birmingham instead of doing his
      first business in London? Why should he turn up at the house of Mr. Gray?
      Why should he control the obscure Mr. Reedman? This behavior is absolutely
      foreign to the character of Charles Bradlaugh. It was not one of his
      weaknesses to beat about the bush. He went straight to his mark, and found
      a way or made one, Death seems to change a man, if we may believe the
      Spiritualists; but if it has altered Charles Bradlaugh's character, it has
      effected a still more startling change in his intellect and expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a "correct copy" of Charles Bradlaugh's message to mankind, and
      most of our readers will regard it as a very Brummagen communication:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I am not to speak (so says the 'Warrior Chief'), I am to say in
      writing, I have found a life beyond the grave that I did not wish for nor
      believe in; but it is even so. My voice shall yet declare it. I have to
      undo all, or nearly all, I have done, but I will not complain. My mind is
      subdued, but I will be a man. It is a most glorious truth that has now
      more clearly dawned upon my mind, that there is a grand and noble purpose
      before all men, worth living for! May this be the dawn of a new and
      glorious era of the spiritual life of your humble friend Charles
      Bradlaugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a God! There is a Divine principle. There is more in life than
      we wot of, but vastly more in death! Oh! for a thousand tongues to declare
      the truths which are now fast dawning upon my bewildered mind! Death, the
      great leveller, need have no more terrors for us, for it has been
      conquered by the Great Spirit, in giving us a never-ending life in the
      glorious spheres of immortal bliss. O my friends! may I be permitted to
      declare, more fully and fervently, the joys which fill my mind. Language
      fails, no tongue can describe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our own impression is that Professor Huxley was justified in saying that
      Spiritualism adds a new terror to death. Fancy the awful depth of flaccid
      imbecility into which Charles Bradlaugh must have fallen, to indulge in
      "ohs," and gasp out "glorious," "glorious," and talk of his "subdued" and
      "bewildered" mind, and bid himself be "a man." It was not thus that he
      spoke in the flesh. His language was manly, firm, and restrained; his
      attitude was bold and self-reliant. After four months in the "spirit
      world" he is positively trembling and drivelling! It is enough to make the
      rugged Iconoclast turn in his grave. Messrs. Gray and Reedman may rely
      upon it that Charles Bradlaugh is <i>not</i> able to enter No. 139
      Pershore-road, Birmingham; if he were, he would descend in swift wrath
      upon his silly traducers, who have put their own inanity into his mouth,
      making the great, virile Atheist talk like a little, flabby Spiritualist
      after an orgie of ginger-beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone may see at a glance that the style of this message, from beginning
      to end, is not Charles Brad-laugh's. <i>Whose</i> style it is we cannot
      say. We do not pretend to fathom the arcana of Spiritualism. It may be Mr.
      Reedmam's, it may be another's. If it be Mr. Reedman's, he must have been
      guilty of fraud or the victim of deception. Three distinct hypotheses are
      possible. Either someone else produced or concocted the message while he
      was in a foolish trance, or he wrote it himself consciously, or he had
      been thinking of Charles Bradlaugh before falling into the foolish trance
      and the message was due to unconscious cerebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forbear to analyse this wretched stuff, though we might show its
      intrinsic absurdity and self-contradiction. One monstrous piece of folly
      bestrides the rest like a colossus&mdash;"Your humble friend Charles
      Bradlaugh." Shade of Uriah Heep! Charles Bradlaugh the "<i>humble</i>
      friend" of the illustrious Gray and Reedman! Think of it, Lord Halsbury;
      think of it, Lord Randolph Churchill. The giant who fought you, and beat
      you, in the law courts and in Parliament; the man whose face was a
      challenge; the man who had the pride, without the malignity, of Lucifer;
      this very man crawls into a Birmingham house, uninvited and unexpected,
      and announces himself as the "<i>humble</i> friend" of some pudding-headed
      people, engaged in a fatuous occupation that makes one blush for one's
      species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely if Charles Bradlaugh's ghost is knocking about this planet, having
      a mission to undo the work of his lifetime in the flesh, it should begin
      the task in London. It was at the Hall of Science that Charles Bradlaugh
      achieved his greatest triumphs as a public teacher, and it is there that
      he should first attempt to undo his work, to unteach his teaching, to
      disabuse the minds of his dupes. Of course we shall be told that he must
      communicate through "mediums," and that the medium must be "controlled" by
      Charles Bradlaugh's spirit; but to this we reply that Charles Bradlaugh
      controlled men easily while he was "in the flesh," and it is inconceivable
      that he has lost that old power if he still survives.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, we think the Spiritist trick is worse than the malignity of
      orthodox Christians. A lie about a man's death-bed ends there, and
      consigning him to hell for his infidelity is only a pious wish that cannot
      affect his fate. But getting hold of a man's ghost ("spirit" they call it)
      after his death; making it turn up at public and private sittings of
      obscure fools; setting it jabbering all the flatulent nonsense of its
      manipulators; and using it in this manner until it has to be dismissed for
      a newer, more fashionable, and more profitable shadow; all this is so
      hideous and revolting that the ordinary Christian lies about infidels seem
      almost a compliment in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Gray-Reedman story is probably the beginning of a long and wretched
      business. The Philistines are upon thee, Charles Bradlaugh! They will
      harness thee in their mill, and make thee grind their grist; and fools
      that were not worth a moment of thy time while thou livedst will command
      thee by the hour; and Sludge the Medium will use thy great name to puff
      his obscene vanity and swell his obscener gains. This is the worst of all
      thy trials, for thou canst not defend thyself; and, in thy helplessness,
      fools and pigmies cut capers over thy grave.

      CHRIST AND BROTHERHOOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clergymen are supposed to be educated; that is, they go to college before
      taking holy orders, and study what are called "the classics"&mdash;the
      masterpieces of Greek and Roman literature. Theology is not enough to fit
      them for the pulpit. They must also be steeped in "the humanities," It is
      felt that they would never find all they require in the Bible. They find a
      great deal of it in Pagan writings, and as these are unknown to the
      people, it is safe for the clergy to work the best "heathen" ideas into
      their interpretation of the Christian Scriptures. There was a time,
      indeed, when Christian preachers were fond of references to Pagan poets
      and philosophers. The people were so ignorant, and such implicit
      believers, that it could be done with security. But now the case is
      altered. The people are beginning to "smell a rat." It dawns upon them
      that if so many fine things were said by those old Pagans&mdash;not to
      mention the still more ancient teaching of India and Egypt&mdash;Christianity
      can hardly merit such epithets as "unique" and "wonderful." Accordingly it
      is becoming the fashion in clerical circles to avoid those old Pagans, or
      else to damn them all in a sweeping condemnation. Some indeed go to the
      length of declaring&mdash;or at least of insinuating&mdash;that all the
      real truth and goodness there is in the world began with the Christian
      era. This extreme is affected by the Evangelical school, and is carried to
      its highest pitch of exaggeration by such shallow and reckless preachers
      as the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes. Soon after the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>
      correspondence on "Is Christianity Played Out?" this reverend gentleman,
      and most accomplished "perverter of the truth," screamed from the platform
      of St. James's Hall that women and children were regarded as slaves and
      nuisances before the time of Christ; which is either a deliberate
      falsehood, or a gross misreading both of history and of human nature. Mr.
      Hughes has since been gathering his energies for a bolder effort in the
      same direction. He now publishes in the <i>Methodist Times</i> his latest
      piece of recklessness or fatuity. It is a sermon on "The Solidarity of
      Mankind," and is really an exhibition of the solidity of Mr. Hughes's
      impudence. It required nothing but "face," as Corbett used to call it, to
      utter such monstrous nonsense in a sermon; it would need a great deal more
      courage than Mr. Hughes possesses to utter it on any platform where he
      could be answered and exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes believes in our "common humanity," and he traces it from "the
      grand old gardener" (Tennyson). "We are all descended from Adam," he says,
      "and related to one another." Now this is not true, even according to the
      Bible; for when Cain fled into the land of Nod he took a wife there, which
      clearly implies the existence of other people than the descendants of
      Adam. But this is not the worst. Fancy a man at this time of day&mdash;a
      burnin' an' a shinin' light to a' this place&mdash;gravely standing up and
      solemnly telling three thousand people, most of whom we suppose have been
      to school, that the legendary Adam of the book of Genesis was really the
      father of the whole human race!
    </p>
    <p>
      This common humanity is claimed by Mr. Hughes as "a purely Christian
      conception." Yet he foolishly admits that "the Positivists in our own day
      have strongly insisted on this great crowning truth which we Christians
      have neglected." Nay, he states that when Kossuth appealed in England on
      behalf of Hungary, he spoke in the name of the "solidarity" of the human
      race. And why <i>solidarity</i>? Because the word had to be taken from the
      French. And why from <i>the French</i>? "Because the French," Mr. Hughes
      says, "have risen to a loftier level of human brotherhood than we."
      Indeed! Then what becomes of your "purely <i>Christian</i> conception,"
      when "infidel France" outshines "Christian England"? How is it, too, you
      have to make the "shameful" confession that "we"&mdash;that is, the
      Christians&mdash;took "nineteen centuries to find out the negro was a man
      and therefore a brother"? You did not find it out, in fact, until the
      eighteenth century&mdash;the century of Voltaire and Thomas Paine&mdash;the
      century in which Freethought had spread so much, even in England, that
      Bishop Butler in the Advertisement to his <i>Analogy</i>, dated May, 1736,
      could say that "many persons" regarded Christianity as proved to be
      "fictitious" to "all people of discernment," and thought that "nothing
      remained but to set it up as a principal subject of mirth and ridicule."
      How is it your "Christian conceptions" took such a surprising time to be
      understood? How is it they had to wait for realisation until the advent of
      an age permeated with the spirit of scepticism and secular humanity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes is brave enough&mdash;in the absence of a critic&mdash;to start
      with Jesus Christ as the first cosmopolitan. "He came of the Jewish
      stock," we are told, "and yet he had no trace of the Jew in him." Of
      course not&mdash;in Christian sermons and Christian pictures, preached and
      painted for non-Jewish, and indeed Jew-hating nations. But there is a very
      decided "trace of the Jew in him" in the New Testament. To the Canaanite
      woman he said, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
      Israel." To the twelve he said, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
      into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost
      sheep of the house of Israel." It was Paul who, finding he could not make
      headway against the apostles who had known Jesus personally, exclaimed,
      "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles." That exclamation was a turning point. It
      was the first real step to such universalism as Christianity has attained.
      No wonder, therefore, that Comte puts Paul instead of Jesus into the
      Positivist calendar, as the real founder of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the case of St. Paul, it is perfectly idle to suppose that his
      cosmopolitanism extended beyond the Roman empire. A little study and
      reflection would show Mr. Hughes that the very fact of the Roman empire
      was the secret of the cosmopolitanism. Moral conceptions follow in the
      wake of political expansion. The morality of a tribe is tribal; that of a
      nation is national; and national morality only developes into
      international morality with the growth of international interests and
      international communication. Now the Roman empire had broken up the old
      nationalities, and with them their local religions. The human mind
      broadened with its political and social horizon. And the result was that a
      cosmopolitan sentiment in morals, and a universal conception in religion,
      naturally spread throughout the territory which was dominated by the Roman
      eagles. Christianity itself was at first a Jewish sect, which developed
      into a cosmopolitan system precisely because the national independence of
      the Jews had been broken up, and all the roads of a great empire were open
      to the missionaries of a new faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to Mr. Hughes's statements. He tells us that the
      solidarity of mankind was "revealed to the human race through St. Paul"&mdash;which
      is a great slur upon Jesus Christ, and quite inconsistent with what Mr.
      Hughes affirms of the Nazarene. It is also inconsistent with the very
      language of St. Paul in that sermon of his to the Athenians; for the great
      apostle, in enforcing his argument that all men are God's children,
      actually reminds the Athenians that "certain also of your own poets have
      said, For we are also his offspring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes goes on to say that "our common humanity" is "a perfectly new
      idea." "Max Muller," he tells us, "says that there was no trace of it
      until Christ came. It is a purely Christian conception." Professor Max
      Muller, however, is not infallible. He sometimes panders to Christian
      prejudices, and this is a case in point. What he says about "humanity" is
      an etymological quibble. Certainly the Greeks knew nothing about it,
      simply because they did not speak Latin. But they had an equivalent word
      in <i>philanthropia</i>, which was in use in the time of Plato, four
      hundred years before the birth of Christ.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. Hughes talks so much that he must have little time for
     reading. Every educated man, however, is supposed to be
     acquainted with Bacon's <i>Essays</i>, the thirteenth of which
     opens as follows:&mdash;"I take goodness in this sense, the
     affecting of the weal of men, which is that the Grecians
     called Philanthropia; and the word humanity (as it is used)
     is a little too light to express it." Bacon not only knew
     the antiquity of <i>Philanthropia</i>, but preferred it to the
     later and less weighty term so ignorantly celebrated by Mr.
     Hughes.
</pre>
    <p>
      Max Muller or no Max Muller, we tell Mr. Hughes that he is either reckless
      or ignorant in declaring that the idea of human brotherhood owes its
      origin to Christ, Paul, or Christianity. To say nothing of Buddha, whose
      ethics are wider than the ethics of Christ, and confining ourselves to
      Greece and Rome, with the teaching of whose thinkers Christianity comes
      into more direct comparison&mdash;it is easy enough to prove that Mr.
      Hughes is in error, or worse. Four centuries before Christ, when Socrates
      was asked on one occasion as to his country, he replied, "I am a citizen
      of the world." Cicero, the great Roman writer, in the century before
      Christ, uses the very word <i>caritas</i>, which St. Paul borrowed in his
      fine and famous chapter in the first of Corinthians. Cicero, and not St.
      Paul, was the first to pronounce "charity" as the tie which unites the
      human race. And after picturing a soul full of virtue, living in charity
      with its friends, and taking as such all who are allied by nature, Cicero
      rose to a still loftier level. "Moreover," he said, "let it not consider
      itself hedged in by the walls of a single town, but acknowledge itself a
      citizen of the whole world, as though one city." In another treatise he
      speaks of "fellowship with the human race, charity, friendship, justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      We defy Mr. Hughes to indicate a single cosmopolitan text in the New
      Testament as strong, clear, and pointed as these sayings of Socrates and
      Cicero&mdash;the one Greek, the other Roman, and both before Christ. Let
      him ransack gospels, epistles, acts, and revelations, and produce the text
      we call for.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Cicero&mdash;that is, from the time of Julius Caesar, and
      the establishment of the Empire&mdash;the sentiment of brotherhood, the
      idea of a common humanity, spread with certainty and rapidity, and is
      reflected in the writings of the philosophers. The exclamation of the
      Roman poet, "As a man, I regard nothing human as alien to me," which was
      so heartily applauded by the auditory in the theatre, expressed a growing
      and almost popular sentiment. The works of Seneca abound in fine
      humanitarian passages, and it must be remembered that if the Christians
      were tortured by Nero at Rome, it was by the same hand that Seneca's life
      was cut short. "Wherever there is a man," said this thinker, "there is an
      opportunity for a deed of kindness." He believed in the natural equality
      of all men. Slaves were such through political and social causes, and
      their masters were bidden to refrain from ill-using them, not only because
      of the cruelty of such conduct, but because of "the natural law common to
      all men," and because "he is of the same nature as thyself." Seneca
      denounced the gladiatorial shows as human butcheries. So mild, tolerant,
      humane, and equitable was his teaching that the Christians of a later age
      were anxious to appropriate him. Tertullian calls him "Our Seneca," and
      the facile scribes of the new faith forged a correspondence between him
      and their own St. Paul. One of Seneca's passages is a clear and beautiful
      statement of rational altruism. "Nor can anyone live happily," he says,
      "who has regard to himself alone, and uses everything for his own
      interests; thou must live for thy neighbor, if thou wouldest live for
      thyself." Eighteen hundred years afterwards Auguste Comte sublimated this
      principle into a motto of his Religion of Humanity&mdash;<i>Vivre pour
      Autrui</i>, Live for Others. It is also expressed more didactically by
      Ingersoll&mdash;"The way to be happy is to make others so"&mdash;making
      duty and enjoyment go hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pliny, who corresponded with the emperor Trajan, and whose name is
      familiar to the student of Christian Evidences, exhorted parents to take a
      deep interest in the education of their children. He largely endowed an
      institution in his native town of Como, for the assistance of the children
      of the poor. His humanity was extended to slaves. He treated his own with
      great kindness, allowing them to dispose of their own earnings, and even
      to make wills. Of masters who had no regard for their slaves, he said, "I
      do not know if they are great and wise; but one thing I do know, they are
      not men." Dion Chrysostom, another Stoic, plainly declared that slavery
      was an infringement of the natural rights of men, who were all born for
      liberty; a dictum which cannot be paralleled in any part of the New
      Testament. It must be admitted, indeed, that Paul, in sending the slave
      Onesimus back to his master Philemon, did bespeak humane and even
      brotherly treatment for the runaway; but he bespoke it for him as a
      Christian, not simply as a man, and uttered no single word in rebuke of
      the institution of slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plutarch's humanity was noble and tender. "The proper end of man," he
      said, "is to love and to be loved." He regarded his slaves as inferior
      members of his own family. How strong, yet how dignified, is his
      condemnation of masters who sold their slaves when disabled by old age. He
      protests that the fountain of goodness and humanity should never dry up in
      a man. "For myself," he said, "I should never have the heart to sell the
      ox which had long labored on my ground, and could no longer work on
      account of old age, still less could I chase a slave from his country,
      from the place where he has been nourished for so long, and from the way
      of life to which he has been so long accustomed." Sentiments like these
      were the natural precursors of the abolition of slavery, as far as it
      could be abolished by moral considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epictetus, the great Stoic philosopher, who had himself been a slave,
      taught the loftiest morality. Pascal admits that he was "one of the
      philosophers of the world who have best understood the duty of man." He
      disdained slavery from the point of view of the masters, as he abhorred it
      from the point of view of the slaves. "As a healthy man," he said, "does
      not wish to be waited upon by the infirm, or desire that those who live
      with him should be invalids, the freeman should not allow himself to be
      waited upon by slaves, or leave those who live with him in servitude." It
      is idle to pretend, as Professor Schmidt of Strasburg does, that the ideas
      of Epictetus are "colored with a reflection of Christianity." The
      philosopher's one reference to the Galileans, by whom he is thought to
      have meant the Christians, is somewhat contemptuous. Professor Schmidt
      says he "misunderstood" the Galileans; but George Long, the translator of
      Epictetus, is probably truer in saying that he "knew little about the
      Christians, and only knew some examples of their obstinate adherence to
      the new faith and the fanatical behavior of some of the converts." It
      should be remembered that Epictetus was almost a contemporary of St. Paul,
      and the accurate students of early Christianity will be able to estimate
      how far it was likely, at that time, to have influenced the philosophers
      of Rome.

      Marcus Aurelius was one of the wisest and best of men. Emperor of the
      civilised world, he lived a life of great simplicity, bearing all the
      burdens of his high office, and drawing philosophy from the depths of his
      own contemplation. His <i>Meditations</i> were only written for his own
      eyes; they were a kind of philosophical diary; and they have the charm of
      perfect sincerity. He was born a.d. 121, he became Emperor a.d. 161, and
      died a.d. 180, after nineteen years of a government which illustrated
      Plato's words about the good that would ensue when kings were philosophers
      and philosophers were kings. Cardinal Barberini, who translated the
      Emperor's <i>Meditations</i> into Italian, in 1675, dedicated the
      translation to his own soul, to make it "redder than his purple at the
      sight of the virtues of this Gentile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcus Aurelius combines reason with beautiful sentiment. His emotion is
      always accompanied by thought. Here, for instance, is a noble passage on
      the social commonwealth&mdash;"For we are made for co-operation, like
      feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower
      teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is
      acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away." In a still
      loftier passage he says&mdash;and let us remember he says it to himself,
      not to an applauding audience, but quietly, and with absolute truth, and
      no taint of theatricality&mdash;"My nature is rational and social; and my
      city and country, so far as I am Antoninus, is Rome; but so far as I am a
      man, it is the world." In his brief, pregnant way, he states the law of
      human solidarity&mdash;"That which is not good for the swarm, neither is
      it good for the bee." And who could fail to appreciate this sentiment,
      coming as it did from the ruler of a great empire?&mdash;"One thing here
      is worth a great deal, to pass thy life in truth and justice, with a
      benevolent disposition even to liars and unjust men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again, it is the fashion in some circles, to pretend that Marcus
      Aurelius was influenced by the spread of Christian ideas. George Long,
      however, speaks the language of truth and sobriety in saying, "It is quite
      certain that Antoninus did not derive any of his Ethical principles from a
      religion of which he knew nothing." To say as Dr. Schmidt does that
      "Christian ideas filled the air" is easy enough, but where is the proof?
      No doubt the Christian writers made great pretensions as to the spread of
      their religion, but they were notoriously sanguine and inaccurate, and we
      know what value to attach to such pretensions in the second century when
      we reflect that even in the fourth century, up to the point of
      Constantine's conversion, Christianity had only succeeded in drawing into
      its fold about a twentieth of the inhabitants of the empire. Enough has
      been said in this article to show that the idea of our common humanity is
      not "a purely Christian conception," that it arose in the natural course
      of human development, and that in this, as in other cases, the apologists
      of Christianity have simply appropriated to their own creed the fruits of
      the political, social, and moral growth of Western civilisation.

    <h2>
      THE SONS OF GOD.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair."
     &mdash;Genesis vi. 8.
</pre>
    <p>
      According to the first book of the Bible, the earth fell into a very
      wicked condition in the days of the patriarchs. God made everything good,
      but the Devil turned everything bad; and in the end the Lord put the whole
      concern into liquidation. It was a case of universal bankruptcy. All that
      was saved out of the catastrophe was a consignment of eight human beings
      and an unknown number of elephants, crocodiles, horses, pigs, dogs, cats,
      and fleas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other enormities of the antediluvian world was the fondness shown by
      the sons of God for the daughters of men. That fondness has continued ever
      since. The deluge itself could not wash out the amatory feelings with
      which the pious males regard those fair creatures who were once supposed
      to be the Devil's chief agents on earth. Even to this day it is a fact
      that courtship goes on with remarkable briskness in religious circles.
      Churches and chapels are places of harmless assignation, and how many
      matches are made in Sunday-schools, where Alfred and Angelina meet to
      teach the scripture and flirt. As for the clergy, who are peculiarly the
      sons of God, they are notorious for their partiality to the sex. They purr
      about the ladies like black tom-cats. Some of them are adepts in the art
      of rolling one eye heavenwards and letting the other languish on the fair
      faces of the daughters of men. It is also noticeable that the Protestant
      clericals marry early and often, and generally beget a numerous progeny;
      while the Catholic priest who, being strictly celibate, <i>never</i> adds
      to the population, "mashes" the ladies through the confessional, worming
      out all their secrets, and making them as pliable as wax in his holy
      hands. Too often the professional son of God is a chartered libertine,
      whose amors are carried on under a veil of sanctity. What else, indeed,
      could be expected when a lot of lusty young fellows, in the prime of life,
      foreswear marriage, take vows of chastity, and undertake to stem the
      current of their natures by such feeble dams as prayers and hymns?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who the original "sons of God" were is a moot point. God only knows, and
      he has not told us. But Jewish and Christian divines have advanced many
      theories. According to some the sons of Gods were the offspring of Seth,
      who was born holy in succession to righteous Abel, while the daughters of
      men were the offspring of wicked Cain. Among the oriental Christians it is
      said that the children of Seth tried to regain Paradise by living in great
      austerity on Mount Hermon, but they soon tired of their laborious days and
      cheerless nights, and cast sheep's-eyes on the daughters of Cain, who
      beauty was equal to their father's wickedness. Marriages followed, and the
      Devil triumphed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the Cabbalists, two angels, Aza and Azael, complained to God
      at the creation of man. God answered, "You, O angels, if you were in the
      lower world, you too would sin." They descended on earth, and directly
      they saw the ladies they forgot heaven. They married and exchanged the
      hallelujahs of the celestial chorus for the tender tones of loving women
      and the sweet prattle of little children. Having sinned, or, to use the
      vile language of religion, "polluted themselves with women," they became
      clothed with flesh. On trying to regain Paradise they failed, and were
      cast back on the mountains, where they continued to beget giants and
      devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were giants in the earth in those days" says Scripture. Of course
      there were. Every barbarous people has similar legends of primitive ages.
      The translators of our Revised Version are ashamed of these mythical
      personages as being too suggestive of Jack and the Beanstalk, so they have
      substituted Anakim for giants. In other words, they have shirked the duty
      of translators, and left the nonsense veiled under the original word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mohammedans say that not only giants, but also Jins, were born of the
      sons of God, who married the daughters of men. The Jins soon had the world
      in their power. They ruled everywhere, and built colossal works, including
      the pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the giants, the most remarkable was Og. He was taller than the last
      Yankee story, for at the Deluge he stopped the windows of heaven with his
      hands, or the water would have risen over his head. The Talmud says that
      he saved himself by swimming close to the ark in company with the
      rhinoceros. The water there happened to be cold, while all the rest was
      boiling hot; and thus Og was saved while all the other giants perished.
      According to another story, Og climbed on the roof of the ark, and when
      Noah tried to dislodge him, he swore that he would become the patriarch's
      slave. Noah at once clinched the bargain, and food was passed through a
      hole for the giant every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we look into them we find the myths of the Bible wonderfully like the
      myths of other systems. The Giants are similar to the Titans, and the
      union of divine males with human females is similar to the amors of
      Jupiter, Apollo, Neptune, and Mars with the women of old. In this matter
      there is nothing new under the sun. Every fresh myth is only the recasting
      of an ancient fable, born of ignorance and imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it finally be noted that this old Genesaic story of the angelic
      husbands of earthly women gives us a poor idea of the felicity of heaven.
      In that unknown region, as Jesus Christ informed his disciples, there is
      neither marrying nor giving in marriage; that is, no males, no females, no
      courting, no loving, no children, and no homes. Men cease to be men and
      women cease to be women. Everybody is of the neuter gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or else all the angels are gentlemen, without a lady amongst them. Perhaps
      the latter view is preferable, as it harmonises with the Bible, in which
      the angels are always <i>he's</i>. In that case heaven would be, to say
      the least, rather a dull place. No whispering in the moonlight, no clasped
      hands under the throbbing stars. Not even a kiss under the misletoe. Oh,
      what must it be to be there! No wonder the sons of God wandered from their
      cheerless Paradise, visited this lower world, and saw the daughters of men
      that they were fair.

    <h2>
      MELCHIZEDEK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Melchizedek is the most extraordinary person of whom we have any record.
      Christ was born and Adam was made, but Melchizedek never began to be and
      will never cease to exist. If the Bible were not such an intensely serious
      book without a gleam of humor, except of the unconscious Hibernian kind,
      we might conclude that Melchizedek was <i>nobody</i>, for the description
      admirably suits that character. But the Bible does not play and must not
      be played with. All its personages are <i>bona fide</i> realities, from
      the Ancient of Days with white woolly hair on the throne of heaven to the
      prophet Jonah who took three days' lodging in the belly of a whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Melchizedek means <i>king</i> of justice, being derived from <i>melec</i>,
      a king, and <i>tzedec</i>, justice. When the gentleman bearing this name
      is introduced to us in the fourteenth of Genesis, he is king of Salem,
      which means peace. Salem was a city on the site of Zion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally it was called Jebus, then Zadek, then Salem, and finally
      Jerusalem. So says Rabbi Joseph Ben-Gorion. But other writers, no doubt
      just as well informed, differ from him; and while the doctors disagree,
      simple laymen may well hold their judgment in suspense; or, better still,
      dismiss Jebus, Zadek, Salem, and Jerusalem, to the limbo of learned
      trivialities. Counting the spots on a leopard, the quills on a porcupine,
      or the hairs in a cat's whiskers, is just as amusing and quite as edifying
      as most of the problems of divines and commentators.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Abraham returned from a successful campaign, in which he defeated
      five kings and their armies with three hundred and eighteen raw recruits,
      Melchizedek came out to meet him with victuals and drink. These two
      friends joined in the friendly office of <i>scratching</i> each other.
      They were, in fact, a small mutual admiration society. Abraham, although
      at other times a rank coward, was on this occasion a bold warrior laden
      with spoil; and Melchizedek besides being King of Salem, was "the priest
      of the most high God." "Bully for you, Abraham," said Melchizedek. "Bully
      for you, Melchizedek," said Abraham. As usual, however, the priest got the
      best of it, for the patriarch paid him tithes, which were a capital return
      for his compliments. Genesis is a little confused, indeed; and what
      scripture is not? "And he gave him tithes of all" is not very clear. It
      reminds one of the West of England yokel, who gave his evidence on a case
      of homicide in this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had a stick, and he had a stick; and he hit he, and he hit he. And if
      he'd only hit he as hard as he hit he, he'd a' killed he, and not he he."
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must not be too hard on Bibles and yokels. So long as we can get a
      scintillation of their meaning we must be satisfied. Scripture, we may
      take it, means that the <i>he</i> who paid tithes was Abraham, and the <i>him</i>
      who received them was Melchizedek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the book of Genesis is not an early, but a very late portion of the
      Jewish scriptures, dating only a few centuries before Christ. And we may
      depend on it that this little sentence about <i>tithes</i>, and perhaps
      the whole story that leads up to it, was got up by the priests, to give
      the authority of Abraham's name and the sanction of antiquity to an
      institution which kept them in luxury at the expense of their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our view of the case is supported by the fact that Melchizedek's name does
      not appear again in the whole of the Old Testament, except in the hundred
      and tenth Psalm, where somebody or other (the parsons of course say
      Christ) is called "a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
      Paul, or whoever wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews, works up this hint in
      fine style. It would puzzle a lunatic, or a fortune-teller, or the
      Archbishop of Canterbury, or God Almighty himself, to say what the Seventh
      of Hebrews means. We give it up as an insoluble conundrum, and we observe
      that every commentator with a grain of sense and honesty does the same.
      But there is one luminous flash in the jumble of metaphysical darkness.
      Melchizedek is described as "without father, without mother, without
      descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life." It will be
      easy to recognise a gentleman of that description when you meet him. When
      we <i>do</i> meet him we shall readily acknowledge him as our king and
      priest, and pay him an income tax of two shillings in the pound; but until
      then we warn all kings and priests off our doorsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewish traditions say that Melchizedek was the son of Shem, and set apart
      for the purpose of watching and burying Adam's carcase when it was
      unshipped from the Ark. Some, however, maintain that he was of a celestial
      race; while other (Christian) speculators have held that he was no less
      than Jesus Christ himself, who put in an early appearance in Abraham's
      days to keep the Jewish pot boiling. St. Athanasius tells a long-winded
      story of Melchizedek and Abraham, which shows what stuff the early
      Christians believed. According to the Talmud, Melchizedek composed the
      hundred and tenth Psalm himself; and although he is without end of days,
      his tomb was shown at Jerusalem in the time of Gemelli Oarrere the
      traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an heretical sect called the <i>Melchizedekiana</i> in the third
      century. They held that Jesus Christ was, according to Hebrews, only of
      the order of Melchizedek, and therefore that Melchizedek himself was the
      more venerable. This heresy revived in Egypt after its suppression
      elsewhere, and its adherents claimed that Melchizedek was the Holy Ghost.
      The last time Melchizedek was heard of he was a London coster-monger's
      donkey, but whether this was a real incarnation of the original
      Melchizedek no one is able to decide, unless the Lord should again, as in
      the case of Balaam's companion, "open the mouth of the ass" and inform the
      world of the things that belong unto its peace.

    <h2>
      S'W'ELP ME GOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whoever has seen a Hebrew money-lender in a County Court take up a copy of
      the Old Testament, present the greasy cover to his greasy lips, and, like
      honest Moses in the <i>School for Scandal</i>, "take his oath on that,"
      must have had a lively impression as to the value of swearing as a
      religious ceremony. And this impression must have been heightened when he
      has seen an ingenuous Christian, on the other side of the suit, present a
      copy of the New Testament to <i>his</i> pious lips, and quietly swear to
      the very opposite of all that the God-fearing Jew had solemnly declared to
      be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. One's
      appreciation of the oath is still further increased by watching the
      various litigants and witnesses as they caress the sacred volume: Here a
      gentleman wears an expression of countenance which seems to imply "I guess
      they'll get a good deal of truth out of me"; and there anothers face seems
      to promise as great a regard for truth as is consistent with his
      understanding with the solicitor who subpoenaed him as an independent
      witness in the interest of justice and a sound client. Hard swearing is
      the order of the day. So conflicting is the evidence on simple matters of
      fact that it is perfectly obvious that the very atmosphere is charged with
      duplicity. The thing is taken as a matter of course. Judges are used to
      it, and act accordingly, deciding in most cases by a keen observation of
      the witnesses and an extensive knowlege of the seamy side of nature. But
      sometimes the very judges are nonplussed, so brazen are the faces of the
      gentlemen who "have kissed the book" Very often, no doubt, their honors
      feel inclined to say, like the American judge in directing his jury,
      "Well, gentlemen, if you believe what these witnesses swear, you will give
      a verdict for the plaintiff; and if you believe what the other witnesses
      swear, you will give a verdict for the defendant; but if, like me, you
      don't believe what either side swears, I'm hanged if I know what you will
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, the oath is absolutely useless if its object is to prevent
      false witness. Should there be any likelihood of a persecution for
      perjury, a two-faced Testament-kisser will be on his guard, and be very
      careful to tell only such lies as cannot be clearly proved against him. He
      dreads the prospect of daily exercise on the treadmill, he loathes the
      idea of picking oakum, and his gorge rises at the thought of brown bread
      and skilly. But so long as that danger is avoided, there are hosts of
      witnesses, most of them very good Christians, who have been suckled on the
      Gospel in Sunday Schools, and fed afterwards on the strong meat of the
      Word in churches and chapels, who will swear fast and loose after calling
      God to witness to their veracity. They ask the Almighty to deal with them
      according as they tell the truth, yet for all that they proceed to tell
      the most unblushing lies. What is the reason of this strange
      inconsistency? Simply this. Hell is a long way off, and many things may
      happen before the Day of Judgment. Besides, God is merciful; he is always
      ready to forgive sins; a man has only to repent in time, that is a few
      minutes before death, and all his sins will be washed out in the cleansing
      blood of Christ. Notwithstanding all his lies in earthly courts, the
      repentant sinner will not lose his right of walking about for ever and
      ever in the court of heaven, although some poor devil whose liberty or
      property he swore away may be frizzling for ever and ever in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are strongly of opinion that if the oath were abolished altogether
      there would be fewer falsehoods told in our public courts. No doubt the
      law of perjury has some effect, but it is less than is generally imagined,
      partly because the law is difficult to apply, and partly because there is
      a wide disinclination to apply it, owing to a sort of freemasonry in false
      witness, which is apt to be regarded as an essential part of the game of
      litigation. Here and there, too, there may be a person of sincere piety,
      who fears to tell a lie in what he considers the direct presence of God.
      But for the most part the fear of punishment, in this world or in the
      next, will not make men veracious. The fact is proved by universal
      experience; nay, there are judges, as well as philosophers, who openly
      declare that the oath has a direct tendency to create perjury. Anyone,
      with a true sense of morality will understand the reason of this. Fear is
      not a moral motive; and when the threatened punishment is very remote or
      very uncertain, it has next to no deterrent effect. Cupidity is matched
      against fear, and the odds of the game being in its favor, it wins. But if
      a moral motive is appealed to, the case is different. Many a man will tell
      a lie in the witness-box who would scruple to do so "on his honor"; many a
      man will lie before God who would scruple to deceive a friend. Let a man
      feel that he is trusted, let his self-respect be appealed to, and he is
      more likely to be veracious than he would be if he were threatened with
      imprisonment in this life and hell-fire in the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Christians should cling to this relic of barbarity it is difficult to
      conceive. Their Savior plainly commanded them to "Swear not at all," and
      the early Church obeyed this injunction until it rose to power under
      Constantine. It is also a striking fact that the apostle Peter, when he
      disobeyed his Master, and took an oath, used it to confirm a palpable lie.
      When the damsel charged him in court with having been a follower of Jesus,
      he "Denied it with an oath." "You were one of them," said the damsel. "I
      wasn't," said Peter. "You <i>were</i> with him," she rejoined. Whereupon
      Peter exclaimed "S'w'elp me God, I never knew him." Surely if
      self-interest made Peter commit flat perjury in the bodily presence of his
      Savior, it is idle to assert that the oath in any way promotes veracity.

     * <i>The Influence of Scepticism on Character</i>. Being the
     sixteenth Fernley Lecture.   By the Rev. William L.
     Watkinson.   London: T. Woolmer.
</pre>
    <p>
      John Wesley was a man of considerable force of mind and singular strength
      of character. But he was very unfortunate, to say the least of it, in his
      relations with women. His marriage was a deplorable misunion, and his
      latest biographer, who aims at presenting a faithful picture of the
      founder of Wesleyanism, has to dwell very largely on his domestic
      miseries. Wesley held patriarchal views on household matters, the proper
      subordination of the wife being a prime article of his faith. Mrs. Wesley,
      however, entertained different views. She is therefore described as a
      frightful shrew, and rated for her inordinate jealousy, although her
      husband's attentions to other ladies certainly gave her many provocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In face of these facts, it might naturally be thought that Wesleyans would
      say as little as possible about the domestic infelicities of Freethinkers.
      But Mr. Watkinson is not to be restrained by any such consideration.
      Although a Wesleyan (as we understand) he challenges comparisons on this
      point. He has read the biographies and autobiographies of several "leading
      Freethinkers," and he invites the world to witness how selfish and sensual
      they were in their domestic relations. He is a pulpit rhetorician, so he
      goes boldly and recklessly to work. Subtlety and discrimination he abhors
      as pedantic vices, savoring too much of "culture." His judgments are of
      the robustious order. Like Jesus Christ, he fancies that all men can be
      divided into sheep and goats. The good are good, and the bad are bad. And
      naturally the good are Christians and bad are Freethinkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first half of Mr. Watkinson's book of 162 pages (it must have been a
      pretty long lecture!) is a preface to the second half, which contains his
      fling at Goethe, Mill, George Eliot, Harriet Martineau, Carlyle, and other
      offenders against the Watkinsonian code. We think it advisable, therefore,
      to follow him through his preface first, and through his "charges"
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embedded in a lot of obscure or questionable matter in Mr. Watkinson's
      exordium is this sentence&mdash;"What we believe with our whole heart is
      of the highest consequence to us." True, but whether it is of the highest
      consequence to other people depends on what it is. Conviction is a good
      thing, but it cannot dispense with the criterion of truth. On the other
      hand, what passes for conviction may often be mere acquiescence. That
      term, we believe, would accurately describe the creed of ninety-nine out
      of every hundred, in every part of the world, whose particular faith is
      merely the result of the geographical accident of their birth. Assuredly
      we do not agree with Mr. Watkinson that "all reasonable people will
      acknowledge that the faith of Christian believers is to a considerable
      extent most real; nay, in tens of thousand of cases it is the most real
      thing in their life." Mr. Cotter Morison laboriously refutes this position
      in his fine volume on <i>The Service of Man</i>. Mill denied and derided
      it in a famous passage of his great essay <i>On Liberty</i>. Mr. Justice
      Stephen denies it in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>. Carlyle also,
      according to Mr. Fronde, said that "religion as it existed in England had
      ceased to operate all over the conduct of men in their ordinary business,
      it was a hollow appearance, a word without force in it." These men may not
      be "reasonable" in Mr. Watkinson's judgment, but with most people their
      word carries a greater weight than his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkinson contends&mdash;and what will not a preacher contend?&mdash;that
      "the denial of the great truths of the Evangelical faith can exert only a
      baneful influence on character." We quite agree with him. But
      evangelicalism, and the great truths of evangelicalism, are very different
      things. It is dangerous to deny any "great truth," but how many does
      evangelicalism possess? Mr. Watkinson would say "many." We should say
      "none." Still less, if that were possible, should we assent to his
      statement that "morals in all spheres and manifestations must suffer
      deeply by the prevalence of scepticism." Mr. Morison, asserts and proves
      that this sceptical age is the most moral the world has seen, and that as
      we go back into the Ages of Faith, vice and crime grow denser and darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the appeal is to history, of which Mr. Watkinson's references do not
      betray a profound knowledge, the verdict will be dead against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Stephen thinks morality can look after itself, but he doubts
      whether "Christian charity" will survive "Christian theology." This
      furnishes Mr. Watkinson with a sufficient theme for an impressive sermon.
      But his notion of "Christian charity" and Mr. Justice Stephen's are very
      different. The hard-headed judge means the sentimentalism and "pathetic
      exaggerations" of the Sermon on the Mount, which he has since distinctly
      said would destroy society if they were fully practised. "Morality," says
      Mr. Watkinson, "would suffer on the mystical side." Perhaps so. It might
      be no longer possible for a Louis the Fifteenth to ask God's blessing when
      he went to debauch a young girl in the <i>Parc aux Cerfs</i>, or for a
      grave philosopher like Mr. Tylor to write in his <i>Anthropology</i> that
      "in Europe brigands are notoriously church-goers." Yet morality might gain
      as much on the practical side as it lost on the mystical, and we fancy
      mankind would profit by the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for Mr. Watkinson's history, which he prints in small capitals,
      probably to show it is the real, unadulterated article. He tell us that
      "the experiment of a nation living practically a purely secular life has
      been tried more than once" with disastrous results. He is, however, very
      careful not to mention these nations, and we defy him to do so. What he
      does is this. He rushes off to Pompeii, whose inhabitants he thinks were
      Secularists! He also reminds us in a casual way that "they had crucified
      Christ a few years before," which again is news. Equally accurate is the
      statement that Pompeii was an "infamous" city, "full" of drunkenness,
      cruelty, etc. Probably Mr. Watkinson, like most good Christians who go to
      Pompeii, visited an establishment, such as we have thousands of in
      Christendom, devoted to the practical worship of Venus without neglecting
      Priapus. He has forgotten the immortal letter of Pliny, and the dead Roman
      sentinel at the post of duty. He acts like a foreigner who should describe
      London from his experience at a brothel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophy comes next. Mr. Watkinson puts in a superior way the clap-trap
      of Christian Evidence lecturers. If man is purely material, and the law of
      causation is universal, where, he asks, "is the place for virtue, for
      praise, for blame?" Has Mr. Watkinson never read the answer to these
      questions? If he has not, he has much to learn; if he has, he should
      refute them. Merely positing and repositing an old question is a very
      stale trick in religious controversy. It imposes on some people, but they
      belong to the "mostly fools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morality is in as much peril as faith," cries Mr. Watkinson. Well, the
      clergy have been crying that for two centuries, yet our criminal
      statistics lessen, society improves, and literature grows cleaner. As for
      the "nasty nude figures" that offend Mr. Watkinson's eyes in the French
      Salon, we would remind him that God Almighty makes everybody naked,
      clothes being a human invention. With respect to the Shelley Society
      "representing the <i>Cenci</i> and other monstrous themes," we conclude
      that Mr. Watkinson does not know what he is talking about. There is incest
      in the <i>Cenci</i>, but it is treated in a high dramatic spirit as a
      frightful crime, ending in bloodshed and desolation. There is also incest
      in the Bible, commonplace, vulgar, bestial incest, recorded without a word
      of disapprobation. Surely when a Christian minister, who says the Bible is
      God's Word, knowing it contains the beastly story of Lot and his
      daughters, cries out against Shelley's <i>Cenci</i> as "monstrous," he
      invites inextinguishable Rabelaisian laughter. No other reply is fitting
      for such a "monstrous" absurdity, and we leave our readers to shake their
      sides at Mr. Watkinson's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkinson asks whether infidelity has "produced new and higher types
      of character." Naturally he answers the question in the negative. "The
      lives of infidel teachers," he exclaims, "are in saddest contrast to their
      pretentious philosophies and bland assumptions." He then passes in review
      a picked number of these upstarts, dealing with each of them in a
      Watkinsonian manner. His rough-and-ready method is this. Carefully leaving
      out of sight all the good they did, and the high example of honest thought
      they set to the world, he dilates upon their failings without the least
      regard to the general moral atmosphere of their age, or the proportion of
      their defects to the entirety of their natures. Mr. Smith, the
      greengrocer, whose horizon is limited to his shop and his chapel, may lead
      a very exemplary life, according to orthodox standards; but his virtues,
      as well as his vices, are rather of a negative character, and the world at
      large is not much the better for his having lived in it. On the other hand
      a man like Mirabeau may be shockingly incontinent, but if in the crisis of
      a nation's history he places his genius, his eloquence, and his heroic
      courage at the service of liberty, and helps to mark a new epoch of
      progress, humanity can afford to pardon his sexual looseness in
      consideration of his splendid service to the race. Judgment, in short,
      must be pronounced on the sum-total of a man's life, and not on a selected
      aspect. Further, the faults that might be overwhelming in the character of
      Mr. Smith, the Methodist greengrocer, may sink into comparative
      insignificance in the character of a great man, whose intellect and
      emotions are on a mightier scale. This truth is admirably expressed in
      Carlyle's <i>Essay on Burns</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the few inches of deflection from the mathematical orbit, which are
      so easily measured, but the <i>ratio</i> of these to the whole diameter,
      constitutes the real aberration. This orbit may be a planet's, its
      diameter the breadth of the solar system; or it may be a city hippodrome;
      nay the circle of a ginhorse, its diameter a score of feet or paces. But
      the inches of deflection only are measured: and it is assumed that the
      diameter of the ginhorse, and that of the planet, will yield the same
      ratio when compared with them! Here lies the root of many a blind, cruel
      condemnation of Burnses, Swifts, Rousseaus, which one never listens to
      with approval. Granted, the ship comes into harbor with shrouds and tackle
      damaged; the pilot is blameworthy; he has not been all-wise and
      all-powerful: but to know <i>how</i> blameworthy, tell us first whether
      his voyage has been round the Globe, or only to Ramsgate and the Isle of
      Dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      We commend this fine passage to Mr. Watkinson's attention. It may make him
      a little more modest when he next applies his orthodox tape and callipers
      to the character of his betters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe is Mr. Watkinson's first infidel hero, and we are glad to see that
      he makes this great poet a present to Freethought. Some Christians claim
      Goethe as really one of themselves, but Mr. Watkinson will have none of
      him. "The actual life of Goethe," he tells us, "was seriously defective."
      Perhaps so, and the same might have been said of hundreds of Christian
      teachers who lived when he did, had they been big enough to have their
      lives written for posterity. Goethe's fault was a too inflammable heart,
      and with the license of his age, which was on the whole remarkably pious,
      he courted more than one pretty woman; or, if the truth must be told, he
      did not repel the pretty women who threw themselves at him. But there were
      thousands of orthodox men who acted in the same way. The distinctive fact
      about Goethe is that he kept a high artistic ideal always before him, and
      cultivated his poetic gifts with tireless assiduity. His sensual
      indulgences were never allowed to interfere with his great aim in life,
      and surely that is something. The result is that the whole world is the
      richer for his labors, and only the Watkinsons can find any delight in
      dwelling on the failings he possessed in common with meaner mortals. To
      say that Goethe should be "an object of horror to the whole
      self-respecting world" is simply to indulge in the twang of the
      tabernacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyle is the next sinner; but, curiously, the <i>Rock</i>, while
      praising Mr. Watkinson's lecture, says that "Carlyle ought not to be
      classed with the sceptics." We dissent from the <i>Rock</i> however; and
      we venture to think that Carlyle's greatest fault was a paltering with
      himself on religious subjects. His intellect rejected more than his tongue
      disowned. Mr. Watkinson passes a very different criticism. Taking Carlyle
      as a complete sceptic, he proceeds to libel him by a process which always
      commends itself to the preachers of the gospel of charity. He picks from
      Mr. Froude's four volumes a number of tid-bits, setting forth Carlyle's
      querulousness, arrogance, and domestic storms with Mrs. Carlyle. Behold
      the man! exclaims Mr. Watkinson. Begging his pardon, it is not the man at
      all. Carlyle was morbidly sensitive by nature, he suffered horribly from
      dyspepsia, and intense literary labor, still further deranging his nerves,
      made him terribly irritable. But he had a fine side to his nature, and
      even a sunny side. Friends like Professor Tyndall, Professor Norton, Sir
      James Stephen, and Mrs. Gilchrist, saw Carlyle in a very different light
      from Mr. Froude's. Besides, Mrs. Carlyle made her own choice. She
      deliberately married a man of genius, whom she recognised as destined to
      make a heavy mark on his age. She had her man of genius, and he put his
      life into his books. And what a life! And what books! The sufficient
      answer to all the Watkinson tribe is to point to Carlyle's thirty volumes.
      This is the man. Such work implies a certain martyrdom, and those who
      stood beside him should not have complained so lustily that they were
      scorched by the fire. Carlyle did a giant's work, and he had a right to
      some failings. Freethinkers see them as well as Mr. Watkinson, but they
      are aware that no man is perfect, and they do not hold up Carlyle, or any
      other sceptic, as a model for universal imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkinson's remarks on George Eliot are simply brutal. She was a
      "wanton." She "lived in free-love with George Henry Lewes." She had no
      excuse for her "license." She was "full of insincerity, cant, and
      hypocrisy." And so on <i>ad nauseam</i>. To call Mr. Watkinson a liar
      would be to descend to his level. Let us simply look at the facts. George
      Eliot lived with George Henry Lewes as his wife. She had no vagrant
      attachments. Her connection with Lewes only terminated with his death. Why
      then did they not marry? Because Lewes's wife was still living, and the
      pious English law would not allow a divorce unless all the household
      secrets were dragged before a gaping public. George Eliot consulted her
      own heart instead of social conventions. She became a mother to Lewes's
      children, and a true wife to him, though neither a priest nor a registrar
      blessed their union. She chose between the law of custom and the higher
      law, facing the world's frown, and relying on her own strength to bear the
      consequences of her act. To call such a woman a wanton and a kept mistress
      is to confess one's self devoid of sense and sensibility. Nor does it show
      much insight to assert that "infidelity betrayed and wrecked her life,"
      and to speculate how glorious it might have been if she had "found Jesus."
      It will be time enough to listen to this strain when Mr. Watkinson can
      show us a more "glorious" female writer in the Christian camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Godwin is the next Freethinker whom Mr. Watkinson calls up for
      judgment. All the brave efforts of the author of <i>Political Justice</i>
      in behalf of freedom and progress are quietly ignored. Mr. Watkinson
      comments, in a true vein of Christian charity, on the failings of his old
      age, censures his theoretical disrespect for the marriage laws, and
      inconsistently blames him for his inconsistency in marrying Mary
      Woolstonecraft. Of that remarkable woman he observes that scepticism
      "destroyed in her all that fine, pure feeling which is the glory of the
      sex." But the only proof he vouchsafes of this startling statement is a
      single sentence from one of her letters, which Mr. Watkinson
      misunderstands, as he misunderstands so many passages in Carlyle's
      letters, through sheer inability to comprehend the existence of such a
      thing as humor. He takes every jocular expression as perfectly serious,
      being one of those uncomfortable persons in whose society, as Charles Lamb
      said, you must always speak on oath. Mr. Watkinson's readers might almost
      exclaim with Hamlet, "How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the
      card, or equivocation will undo us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next culprit is Shelley, who, we are told, "deserted his young wife
      and children in the most shameful and heartless fashion." It does not
      matter to Mr. Watkinson that Shelley's relations with Harriet are still a
      perplexing problem, or that when they parted she and the children were
      well provided for, Nor does he condescend to notice the universal
      consensus of opinion among those who were in a position to be informed on
      the subject, that Harriet's suicide, more than two years afterwards, had
      nothing to do with Shelley's "desertion." Instead of referring to proper
      authorities, Mr. Watkinson advises his readers to consult "Mr.
      Jeafferson's painstaking volumes on the <i>Real Shelley</i>." Mr.
      Jeafferson's work is truly painstaking, but it is the work of an advocate
      who plays the part of counsel for the prosecution. Hunt, Peacock, Hogg,
      Medwin, Lady Shelley, Rossetti, and Professor Dowden&mdash;these are the
      writers who should be consulted. Shelley was but a boy when Harriet
      Westbrook proposed to run away with him. Had he acted like the golden
      youth of his age, and kept her for a while as his mistress, there would
      have been no scandal. His father, in fact, declared that he would hear
      nothing of marriage, but he would keep as many illegitimate children as
      Shelley chose to get. It was the intense chivalry of Shelley's nature that
      turned a very simple affair into a pathetic tragedy. Mr. Watkinson's
      brutal methods of criticism are out of place in such a problem. He lacks
      insight, subtlety, delicacy of feeling, discrimination, charity, and even
      an ordinary sense of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Mill is another flagrant sinner. Mr. Watkinson goes to the length of
      blaming him because "his temper was constitutionally irritable," as though
      he constructed himself. Here, again, Mr. Watkinson's is a purely debit
      account. He ignores James Mill's early sacrifices for principle, his
      strenuous labor for what he considered the truth, and his intense devotion
      to the education of his children. His temper was undoubtedly austere, but
      it is more than possible that this characteristic was derived from his
      forefathers, who had been steeped in the hardest Calvinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stuart Mill was infatuated with Mrs. Taylor, whom he married when she
      became a widow. But Mr. Watkinson conceals an important fact. He talks of
      "selfish pleasure" and "indulgence," but he forgets to tell his readers
      that Mrs. Taylor was <i>a confirmed invalid</i>. It is perfectly obvious,
      therefore, that Mill was attracted by her mental qualities; and it is easy
      to believe Mill when he disclaims any other relation than that of
      affectionate friendship. No one but a Watkinson could be so foolish as to
      imagine that men seek sensual gratification in the society of invalid
      ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet Martineau is "one of the unloveliest female portraits ever
      traced." Mr. Watkinson is the opposite of a ladies' man. Gallantry was
      never his foible. He hates female Freethinkers with a perfect hatred. He
      pours out on Harriet Martineau his whole vocabulary of abuse. But it is,
      after all, difficult to see what he is in such a passion about. Harriet
      Martineau had no sexual sins, no dubious relations, no skeleton in the
      domestic cupboard. But, says Mr. Watkinson, she was arrogant and
      censorious. Oh, Watkinson, Watkinson! have you not one man's share of
      those qualities yourself? Is there not "a sort of a smack, a smell to" of
      them in your godly constitution?
    </p>
    <p>
      We need not follow Mr. Watkinson's nonsense about "the domestic shrine of
      Schopenhauer," who was a gay and festive bachelor to the day of his death.
      As for Mr. Watkinson's treatment of Comte, it is pure Christian; in other
      words, it contains the quintessence of uncharitableness. Comte had a taint
      of insanity, which at one time necessitated his confinement. That he was
      troublesome to wife and friends is not surprising, but surely a man
      grievously afflicted with a cerebral malady is not to be judged by
      ordinary standards. Comte's genius has left its mark on the nineteenth
      century; he was true to <i>that</i> in adversity and poverty. This is the
      fact posterity will care to remember when the troubles of his life are
      buried in oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watkinson turns his attention next to the French Revolution, which he
      considers "as much a revolt against morals as it was against despotism."
      If that is his honest opinion, he must be singularly ignorant. The moral
      tone of the Revolutionists was purity itself compared with the flagrant
      profligacy of the court, the aristocracy, and the clergy, while
      Freethinkers were imprisoned, and heretics were broken on the wheel. We
      have really no time to give Mr. Watkinson lessons in French history, so we
      leave him to study it at his leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that Voltaire should come in for his share of slander. All
      Mr. Watkinson can see in him is that he wrote "an unseemly poem," by which
      we presume he means <i>La Pucelle</i>. But he ought to know that the
      grosser parts of that poem were added by later hands, as may be seen at a
      glance in any variorum edition. In any case, to estimate Voltaire's <i>Pucelle</i>
      by the moral standard of a century later is to show an absolute want of
      judgment. Let it be compared with similar works of <i>his</i> age, and it
      will not appear very heinous. But Voltaire did a great deal besides the
      composition of that poem. He fought despotism like a hero, he stabbed
      superstition to the heart, he protected the victims of ecclesiastical and
      political tyranny at the risk of his own life, he sheltered with exquisite
      generosity a multitude of orphans and widows, he assisted every genius who
      was trodden down by the age. These things, and the great mass of his
      brilliant writings, will live in the memory of mankind. Voltaire was not
      perfect; he shared some of the failings of his generation. But he fought
      the battle of freedom and justice for sixty years. Other men indulged in
      gallantry, other men wrote free verses. But when Calas was murdered by the
      priests, and his family desolated, it was Voltaire, and Voltaire alone,
      who faced the tyrants and denounced them in the name of humanity. His
      superb attitude on that critical occasion inspired the splendid eulogium
      of Carlyle, who was no friendly witness: "The whole man kindled into one
      divine blaze of righteous indignation, and resolution to bring help
      against the world."

    <h2>
      ARE ATHEISTS CRUEL? *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * April 26,1891.
</pre>
    <p>
      There seems to be an ineradicable malignancy in the heart of professional
      Christianity. St. Paul, indeed in a fine passage of his first epistle to
      the Corinthians, speaks with glowing eloquence of the "charity" which
      "thinketh no evil." But the hireling advocates and champions of
      Christianity have ever treated the apostle's counsel with contempt in
      their dealings with sceptics and heretics. Public discussion is avoided by
      these professors of the gospel of love and practisers of the gospel of
      hatred. They find it "unprofitable." Consequently they neglect argument
      and resort to personalities. They frequently insinuate, and when it is
      safe they openly allege, that all who do not share their opinions are bad
      husbands, bad fathers, bad citizens, and bad men. Thus they cast libellous
      dust in the eyes of their dupes, and incapacitate them from seeing the
      real facts of the case for themselves. A notable illustration of this evil
      principle may be found in a recent speech by the Bishop of Chester. Dr.
      Jayne presided at a Town Hall meeting of the local branch of the National
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and took advantage of
      the occasion to slander a considerable section of his fellow citizens.
      With a pious arrogance which is peculiar to his boastful faith, he turned
      what should have been a humanitarian assembly into a receptacle for his
      discharge of insolent fanaticism. Parentage is a natural fact, and the
      love of offspring is a well-nigh universal law of animal life. It would
      seem, therefore, that a Society for preventing cruelty to children by
      parents of perverted instincts, might live aloof from sectarian squabbles.
      But the Bishop of Chester is of a different opinion. He is a professional
      advocate of one form of faith, and his eye is strictly bent on business.
      He appears to be unable to talk anything but "shop." Even while pressing
      the claims of poor, neglected, ill-used children on the sympathy and
      assistance of a generous public, he could not refrain from insulting all
      those who have no love for his special line of business. And the insult
      was not only gratuitous; it was groundless, brutal, and malignant; so much
      so, indeed, that we cherish a hope that the Bishop has overreached
      himself, and that his repulsive slander will excite a re-action in favor
      of the objects of his malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Jayne told the meeting that "the persons who were most liable to be
      guilty of cruelty to their children were those artisans who had taken up
      Secularist opinions, and who looked upon their children as a nuisance, and
      were glad to get them out of the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the face of it, the statement is positively grotesque in its
      absurdity. If Secular principles tend to make parents hate their own
      children, why should their evil influence be confined to artisans? And if
      Secular principles do not produce parental hatred in the wealthier
      classes, why does Dr. Jayne hurl this disgraceful accusation at the poorer
      class of unbelievers? It cannot be simply because they are poorer, for he
      was delighted to know that "poverty by no means necessarily meant
      cruelty." What, then, is the explanation? It seems to us very obvious. Dr.
      Jayne was bent on libelling sceptics, and, deeming it <i>safer</i> to
      libel the <i>poorer</i> ones, he tempered his valor with a convenient
      amount of discretion. He is not even a brave fanatic. His bigotry is
      crawling, cowardly, abject, and contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Jayne relied upon the authority of Mr. Waugh, who happened to be
      present at the meeting. This gentleman jumped up in the middle of the
      Bishop's speech, and said "it was the case, that the class most guilty of
      cruelty to children were those who took materialistic, atheistic, selfish
      and wicked views of their own existence." Surely this is a "fine
      derangement of epitaphs." It suggests that Mr. Waugh is less malignant
      than foolish. What connection does he discover between Secularism and
      selfishness? Is it in our principles, in our objects, or in our policy?
      Does he really imagine that the true character of any body of men and
      women is likely to be written out by a hostile partisan? Such a person
      might be a judge of our <i>public</i> actions, and we are far from denying
      his right to criticise them; but when he speaks of our <i>private</i>
      lives, before men of his own faith, and without being under the necessity
      of adducing a single scrap of evidence, it is plain to the most obtuse
      intelligence that his utterances are perfectly worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have as much right as Mr. Waugh to ask the world to accept our view of
      the private life of Secularists. That is, we have no right at all.
      Nevertheless we have a right to state our experience and leave the reader
      to form his own opinion. Having entered the homes of many Secularists, we
      have been struck with their fondness for children The danger lies, if it
      lies anywhere, in their tendency to "spoil" them. It is a curious fact&mdash;and
      we commend it to the attention of Dr. Jayne and Mr. Waugh&mdash;that the
      most sceptical country in Europe is the one where children are the best
      treated, and where there is no need for a Society to save them from the
      clutches of cruelty. There is positively a child-cultus in the great
      French cities, and especially in Freethinking Paris. In this
      Bible-and-beer-loving land the workman, like his social "superior," stands
      or sits drinking in a public-house with male cronies; but the French
      workman usually sits at the <i>cafe</i> table with his wife, and on
      Sundays with his children, and takes his drink, whatever it may be, under
      the restraining eyes of those before whom a man is least ready to debase
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Secular home, at least, is known to us intimately. It is the home of
      the present writer, who for the moment drops the editorial "we" and speaks
      in the first person My children are the children of an Atheist, yet if
      they do not love me as heartily as Dr. Jayne's or Mr. Waugh's children
      love their father, "there's witchcraft in it." There is no rod, and no
      punishment in my home. We work with the law of love. Striking a child is
      to me a loathsome idea. I shrink from it as I would from a physical
      pollution. Strike a child once, be brutal to it once, and there is gone
      forever that look of perfect trust in the child's eyes, which is a
      parent's dearest possession, and which I would not forfeit for all the
      prizes in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know Christians who are less kind to their children than I am to mine.
      They are not my natural inferiors. Humanity forbid that I should play the
      Pharisee! But they are degraded below their natural level by the ghastly
      notion of parental "authority" I do not say there are no rights in a
      family. There <i>are</i>; and there are also duties. But all the rights
      belong to the children, and all the duties belong to the parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally I am not fond of talking about myself. Still less am I anxious
      to make a public exhibition of my home. But if the Dr. Jaynes and the Mr.
      Waughs of the Christian world provoke comparisons, I have no fear of
      standing with my little ones opposite them with theirs, and letting the
      world judge between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping again into the editorial style, we have a question to ask of the
      Bishop of Chester, or rather of Mr. Waugh. It is this. Where are the
      statistics to justify your assertion? Men who are sent to gaol, for
      whatever reason, have their religions registered. Give us, then, the total
      number of convictions your Society has obtained, and the precise
      proportion of Secularists among the offenders. And be careful to give us
      their names and the date and place of their conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a further word to all sorts and conditions of libellous
      Christians. Where are the evidences of Atheistic cruelty? The humanest of
      the Roman emperors were those who were least under the sway of religion.
      Julius Caesar himself, the "foremost man of all this world," who was a
      professed Atheist, was also the most magnanimous victor that ever wore the
      purple. Akbar, the Freethinker, was the noblest ruler of India. Frederick
      the Great was kind and just to his subjects. But, on the other hand, who
      invented and who applied such instruments of cruelty as racks, wheels, and
      thumbscrews? Who invented separate tortures for every part of the
      sensitive frame of man? Who burnt heretics? Who roasted or drowned
      millions of "witches"? Who built dungeons and filled them? Who brought
      forth cries of agony from honest men and women that rang to the tingling
      stars? Who burnt Bruno? Who spat filth over the graves of Paine and
      Voltaire? The answer is one word&mdash;Christians. Yet with all this blood
      on their hands, and all this crime on their consciences, they turn round
      and fling the epithet of "cruel" at the perennial victims of their malice.

    <h2>
      ARE ATHEISTS WICKED?
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the most effective arts of priestcraft has been the
      misrepresentation and slander of heretics. To give the unbeliever a bad
      name is to prejudice believers against all communication with him. By this
      means a twofold object is achieved; first, the faithful are protected from
      the contagion of scepticism; secondly, the notion is propagated that there
      is something essentially immoral involved in, or attendant upon,
      unorthodox opinions; and thus the prevalent religious ideas of the age
      become associated with the very preservation and stability of the moral
      order of human society.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of trickery cannot, of course, be played upon the students of
      civilisation, who, as Mill remarked, are aware that many of the most
      valuable contributions to human improvement have been the work of men who
      knew, and rejected, the Christian faith. But it easily imposes on the
      multitude, and it will never be abandoned until it ceases to be
      profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it takes the form of idle stories about the death-beds of
      Freethinkers, who are represented as deploring their ill-spent life, and
      bewailing the impossibility of recalling the wicked opinions they have put
      into circulation. At other times it takes the form of exhibiting their
      failings, without the slightest reference to their virtues, as the sum and
      substance of their character. When these methods are not sufficient,
      recourse is had to insinuation. Particular sceptics are spared perhaps,
      but Freethinkers are depicted&mdash;like the poor in Tennyson's "Northern
      Farmer"&mdash;as bad in the lump. It is broadly hinted that it is a moral
      defect which prevents them from embracing the popular creed; that they
      reject what they do not wish to believe; that they hate the restraints of
      religion, and therefore reject its principles; that their unbelief, in
      short, is only a cloak for sensual indulgence or an excuse for evading
      irksome obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are so accustomed to this monstrous theory of scepticism in religious
      circles, that it did not astonish us, or give us the least surprise, to
      read the following paragraph in the <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Free Life, and No Compulsory Virtue, was the title of a placard borne by
      a pamphlet seller of the public highway a few days ago. What the contents
      of the pamphlets were we do not know, but the title is a suggestive sign
      of the times, and a rather more than usually plain statement of what a
      good deal of modern doubt amounts to. Lord Tennyson was severely taken to
      task a few years ago for making the Atheist a villain in his 'Promise of
      May,' but he was about right. Much of the doubt of the day is only an
      outcome of the desire to discredit and throw off the restraints of
      religion and moral law in the name of freedom, wrongly used. Free love,
      free life, free divorce, free Sundays, in the majority of cases, are but
      synonyms for license. Those who hold the Darwinian doctrine of descent
      from a kind of ape may yet see it proved by a reversion to the beast, if
      men succeed in getting all the false and pernicious freedom they want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in reply to this paragraph, we have first to observe that our
      contemporary takes Lord Tennyson's name in vain. The villain of the
      "Promise of May" is certainly an Agnostic, but are not the villains of
      many other plays Christians? Lord Tennyson does not make the rascal's
      wickedness the logical result of his principles; indeed, although our
      contemporary seems ignorant of the fact, he disclaimed any such intention,
      A press announcement was circulated by his eldest son, on his behalf, that
      the rascal was meant to be a sentimentalist and ne'er-do-well, who,
      whatever his opinions, would have come to a bad end. When the <i>Commonwealth</i>,
      therefore, talks of Lord Tennyson as "about right," it shows, in a rather
      vulgar way, the danger of incomplete information. Were we to copy its
      manners we might use a swifter phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Atheists, in the name of freedom, throw off the restraints of moral
      law, is a statement which we defy the <i>Commonwealth</i> to prove, or in
      the slightest degree to support, and we will even go to the length of
      suggesting how it might undertake the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turpitude of character must betray itself. Moral corruption can no more be
      hidden than physical corruption. Wickedness "will out," like murder or
      smallpox. A man's wife discovers it; his children shun him instead of
      clinging about his knees; his neighbors and acquaintances eye him with
      suspicion or dislike; his evil nature pulsates through an ever-widening
      circle of detection, and in time nis bad passions are written upon his
      features in the infallible lines of mouth and eyes and face. How easy,
      then, it should be to pick out these Atheists. The most evil-looking men
      should belong to that persuasion. But do they? We invite our contemporary
      to a trial. Let it inquire the religious opinions of a dozen or two, and
      see if there is an Atheist among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, a certain amount of evil disposition <i>must</i> produce a certain
      percentage of criminal conduct. Accordingly the gaols should contain a
      large proportion of Atheists. But <i>do</i> they? Statistics prove they do
      <i>not</i>. When the present writer was imprisoned for "blasphemy," and
      was asked his religion, he answered "None," to the wide-eyed astonishment
      of the official who put the question. Atheists were scarce in the
      establishment. Catholics were there, and red tickets were on their
      cell-doors; Protestants were there, and white tickets marked their
      apartments; Jews were there, and provision was made for their special
      observances; but the Atheist was the <i>rara avis</i>, the very phoenix of
      Holloway Gaol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us turn to another method of investigation. During the last ten years
      four members have been expelled from the House of Commons. One of them was
      not expelled in the full sense of the word; he was, however, thrust by
      brute force from the precincts of the House. His name was Charles
      Bradlaugh, and he was an Atheist. But what was his crime? Simply this: he
      differed from his fellow members as to his competence to take the
      parliamentary oath, and the ultimate event proved that he was right and
      they were wrong. Now what were the crimes of the three other members, who
      were completely and absolutely expelled? Captain Verney was found guilty
      of procuration for seduction, Mr. Hastings was found guilty of
      embezzlement, and Mr. De Cobain was pronounced guilty of evading justice,
      while charged with unnatural offences. Mr. Jabez Spencer Balfour might
      also have been expelled, if he had not accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. Now
      all these <i>real</i> delinquents were Christians, and even ostentatious
      Christians. Compare them with Charles Bradlaugh, the Atheist, and say
      which side has the greatest cause for shame and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are Atheists conspicuous in the Divorce Court? Is it not Christian
      reputations that are smirched in that Inquisition? Do Atheists, or any
      species of unbelievers, appear frequently before the public as promoters
      of bubble companies, and systematic robbers of orphans and widows? Is it
      not generally found, in the case of great business collapses, that the
      responsible persons are Christians? Is it not a fact that their profession
      of Christianity is usually in proportion to the depth of their rascality?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long since the Bishop of Chester, backed up by Mr. Waugh, of the
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, publicly declared that
      the worst ill-users of little ones were artisan Secularists. He was
      challenged to give evidence of the assertion, but he preferred to maintain
      what is called "a dignified silence." Mr. Waugh was challenged to produce
      proofs from the Society's archives, and he also declined. It is enough to
      affirm infamy against Freethinkers; proof is unnecessary; or, rather, it
      is unobtainable. Singularly, there have been several striking cases of
      brutal treatment of children since Mr. Waugh and Bishop Jayne committed
      themselves to this indefensible assertion, and in no instance was the
      culprit a Secularist, though some of them, including Mrs. Montagu, were
      devout Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other methods of inquiry into the wickedness of Atheists, but we
      have indicated enough to set the <i>Commonwealth</i> at work, and we
      invite it to begin forthwith. And while it is getting ready we beg to
      observe that theologians have always described "free-dem" as "license,"
      whereas it is nothing of the kind. Freedom is the golden mean between
      license and slavery. The breaking of arbitrary fetters, forged by
      ignorance and intolerance, does not mean a fall into loose living. The
      heretic in religion, while resenting outside control, by his very
      perception of the vast and far-reaching consequences of human action, is
      often chained to "the most timid sanctities of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to "the Darwinian theory of descent from a kind of ape," we
      have a word for our contemporary. The annual meeting of the British
      Association was held at Oxford in 1860. Darwin's <i>Descent of Man</i> had
      recently been published, and the air was full of controversy. Bishop
      Wilberforce, in the course of a derisive speech, turned to Professor
      Huxley and asked whether it was on the mother's or father's side that his
      grandfather had been an ape. Huxley replied that man had no reason to be
      ashamed of having an ape for a grandfather. "If there is an ancestor," he
      continued, "whom I should feel shame in recalling it would be a <i>man</i>"&mdash;one
      who meddled with scientific questions he did not understand, only to
      obscure them by aimless rhetoric, and indulgence in "eloquent digressions
      and appeals to religious prejudice." This rebuke was administered
      thirty-three years ago, but it is still worth remembering, and perhaps the
      <i>Commonwealth</i> may find in it something applicable to itself.

    <h2>
      RAIN DOCTORS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The prolonged drought has already inflicted serious injury on the farmers.
      They are, as a rule, a loyal class of men, but their loyalty will probably
      be shaken when they realise that the Lord has spoiled their crops to
      provide Queen's weather for the Jubilee. An occasional shower might wet
      the Queen's parasol or ruffle the plumage of the princes and princelings
      in her train. Occasional showers, however, are just what the farmers want.
      The Lord was therefore in a fix. Though the Bible says that with him
      nothing is impossible, he was unable to please both sides; so he favored
      the one he loved best, gave royalty unlimited sunshine, and played the
      deuce with the agricultural interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the Lord knows better than we do, but we venture to suggest that
      a slight exercise of intelligence, though we admit it may have been a
      strain upon his slumbrous brain, would have surmounted the difficulty. The
      windows of heaven might have been opened from two till four in the
      morning. That would have been sufficient for a proper supply of rain, and
      the whole of the day could have been devoted to "blazing" without injuring
      anyone. Or, if the early morning rain would have damaged the decorations,
      the celestial turnkey might have kept us a week without water giving us an
      extra supply beforehand. On the whole, if we may hazard so profane an
      observation, the powers above are singularly behind the age. Their affairs
      are frightfully mixed, and the result is that capital and labor are both
      in a state of uncertainty. The celestial dynasty will have to improve, or
      its imperial power will be questioned, and there will be a demand for Home
      Rule with regard to the weather. It is a perfect nuisance, with respect to
      a matter which vitally affects us, not to be able to know what a day will
      bring forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile we turn to the clergy, and inquire why they do not perform their
      professional duties in this emergency. There is a form of prayer for such
      cases in the Prayer-book. Why has it not been used? Do the clergy think
      the Lord is growing deaf with old age? Have they a secret suspicion that
      praying for a change of weather is as useful as whistling for the wind? Or
      has the spirit of this sceptical age invaded the clerical ranks so
      thoroughly as to make them ashamed of their printed doctrines? When a
      parish clerk was told by the parson one morning that the prayer for rain
      would be read, he replied, "Why, sir, what's the use of praying for rain
      with the wind in that quarter?" We fancy that parish clerk must have a
      good many sympathisers in the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the clergy should do what they are paid for, or resign the business.
      They are our rain doctors, and they should procure us the precious fluid.
      If they cannot, why should we pay them a heavenly water-rate? The rain
      doctors of savages are kept to their contract. They are expected to bring
      rain when it is required, and if they do not, the consequences are
      unpleasant. They are sometimes disgraced, and occasionally killed. But the
      rain doctors in civilised countries retain all the advantages of their
      savage prototypes without any of their risks and dangers. Modern
      Christians allow the clergy to play on the principle of "heads I win,
      tails you lose." If the black regiments pray and there is no answer,
      Christians resign themselves to the will of God. If there <i>is</i> an
      answer, they put it to the credit of the priests, or the priests put it to
      their own credit, which is much the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be sorry to charge such a holy body of men with duplicity, but
      is there not "a sort of a smack, a smell to?" They are reluctant to pray
      for rain, on the alleged ground that Omnipotence should not be interfered
      with rashly. But the sincerity of this plea is questionable when we
      reflect that it obviously favors the clergy. Our climate is variable, long
      spells of particular weather are infrequent, and if when one occurs the
      clergy hold back till the very last, their supplication for a change
      cannot long remain unanswered. But perhaps this is only an illustration of
      the wisdom of the serpent which Jesus recommended to his apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the clergy are anxious to exhibit their powers they should pray for
      rain in the desert of Sahara. Missionaries might be sent out to establish
      praying stations, and in the course of time the desert might bloom as a
      garden, and the wilderness as a rose. We make the suggestion in all
      sincerity. We are anxious to be convinced, if conviction is possible.
      Praying for rain in a watery climate is one thing, praying for rain where
      none ever falls is another. If the clergy can bring down a fruitful shower
      on the African sands, we shall cry, "A miracle," and send them a quarter's
      pew-rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously&mdash;for we can be serious&mdash;we ask the clergy to do their
      level best. The farmers are swearing wholesale, and by taking the name of
      the Lord their God in vain they incur the peril of eternal damnation. The
      fruit crop is injured, and children suffer unusually from the
      stomach-ache. Worst of all, infidel France is flooding our markets with
      cherries and other fruits, and we are supporting the accursed sceptical
      brood because the Lord has not nourished our own growths. Surely then it
      is time to act. If the parsons lose this fine opportunity they may rely on
      it that the anti-tithe agitation will develop into alarming proportions.
      Their livings are at stake, and we ask them to consider the interests of
      their wives and families. If our generous warning is unheeded the clergy
      may find the nation carrying out the principle of free trade in religion,
      and importing some rain doctors from Africa. Many of these magical
      blackmen would be glad to exchange their present pickings for a vicarage
      and five hundred a year. If they thought there was a chance of obtaining a
      bishopric, with a palace and six or ten thousand a year, they would start
      for England at once. Many of them are of excellent reputation, and would
      come to us with the best of testimonials. Would it not be well to give
      them a trial? We should find out who was best at the business. He might be
      constituted our national rain doctor at a liberal salary, and the rest
      discharged; for surely the Lord does not require thirty thousand praying
      to him at once, unless on the principle that he must be surrounded to
      prevent the prayer from going into one ear and out at the other.

    <h2>
      PIOUS PUERILITIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Faith and credulity are the same thing with different names. When a man
      has plenty of faith he is ready to believe anything. However fantastic it
      may be, however childish, however infantile, he accepts it with gaping
      wonder. His imagination is not necessarily strong, but it is easily
      excited. Macaulay held that savages have stronger imaginations than
      civilised men, and that as the reason developes the imagination decays.
      But, in our opinion, he was mistaken. The imagination does not wither
      under the growth of reason; on the contrary, it flourishes more strongly.
      It is, however, disciplined by reason, and guided by knowledge; and it
      only appears to be weaker because the relation between it and other
      faculties has changed. The imagination of the savage seems powerful
      because his other faculties are weak. In the absence of knowledge it cuts
      the most astonishing capers, just as a bird would if it were suddenly
      deprived of sight. Now the savage is a mental child, and the ignorant and
      thoughtless are mental savages. They credit the absurdest stories, and
      indulge in the most ridiculous speculations. When religion ministers to
      their weakness, as it always does, they gravely discuss the most
      astonishing puerilities. Indeed, the history of religious thought&mdash;that
      is, of the infantile vagaries of the human mind&mdash;is full of
      puerilites. There is hardly an absurdity which learned divines have not
      debated as seriously as scientists discuss the nebular hypothesis or the
      evolution theory. They have argued how many angels could dance on the
      point of a needle; whether Adam had a navel; whether ghosts and demons
      could cohabit with women; whether animals could sin; and what was to be
      done with a rat that devoured a holy wafer. We believe the decision of the
      last weighty problem, after long debate, was that the rat, having the body
      of Christ in its body, was sanctified, and that it had to be eaten by the
      priest, by which means the second person of the Trinity was saved from
      desecration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all the pious puerilities on record, probably the worst are
      ascribed to the rabbis. The faith of those gentlemen was unbounded, and
      they were so fond of trivialities, that where they found none they
      manufactured them. The rabbis belonged to the most credulous race of
      antiquity. "Tell that to the Jews," as we see from Juvenal, was as common
      as our saying, "Tell that to the marines." The chosen people were
      infinitely superstitious. They had no head for science, nor have they to
      this day; but they were past-masters in every magical art, and
      connoisseurs in amulets and charms. Their rabbis were the hierophants of
      their fanatical folly. They devoted amazing industry, and sometimes
      remarkable ingenuity, to its development; frequently glossing the very
      scriptures of their religion with dexterious imbecilities that raise a
      sinister admiration in the midst of our laughter. This propensity is most
      noticeable in connection with Bible stories. When the chroniclers and
      prophets record a good solemn wonder, which reads as though it ought to be
      true if it is not, they allege or suggest little additions that give it an
      air of ostentatious silliness. Hundreds of such instances have come under
      my eyes in foraging for extra-Biblical matter for my <i>Bible Heroes</i>,
      but I have only room for one or two specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Nimrod was jealous of young Abraham, as Herod was jealous of young
      Jesus. He tried various methods to get rid of the boy, but all in vain. At
      last he resolved to burn Abraham alive. This would have made a striking
      scene, but the pious puerility of the sequel spoils it all. The king
      issued a decree, ordering every man in his kingdom to bring wood to heat
      the kiln. What a laughable picture! Behold every adult subject wending his
      way to the crematorium with a bundle of sticks on his back&mdash;"For
      Abraham." The The Mussulman tradition (Mohammedans and Jews are much
      alike, and both their religions are Semitic) informs us that Nimrod
      himself died in the most extraordinary manner. A paltry little gnat, with
      a game leg and one eye, flew up his nostril, and lodged in his brain,
      where it tormented him for five hundred years. During the whole of that
      period, in which the gnat displayed a longevity that casts Methuselah's
      into the shade, the agonising king could only obtain repose by being
      struck on the head; and relays of men were kept at the palace to pound his
      royal skull with a blacksmith's hammer. The absurdity of the story is
      transcendent. One is charitably tempted to believe, for the credit of
      human nature, that it was the work of a subtle, solemn wag, who thought it
      a safe way of satirising the proverbial thick-headedness of kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      What reader of the Bible does not remember the pathetic picture of Esau
      falling on Jacob's neck and weeping, in a paroxysm of brotherly love and
      forgiveness? But the rabbis daub it over with their pious puerilities.
      They solemnly inform us that Esau was a trickster, as though Jacob's
      qualities were catching? and that he tried to bite his brother's neck, but
      God turned it into marble, and he only broke his teeth. Esau wept for the
      pain in his grinders. But why did Jacob weep? This looks like a poser, yet
      later rabbis surmounted the difficulty. Jacob's neck was not turned into
      marble, but toughened. It was hard enough to-hurt Esau's teeth, and still
      tender enough to make Jacob suffer, so they cried in concert, though for
      different reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satyrs are mentioned in the Bible, although they never existed outside the
      superstitious imagination. The rabbis undertook to explain the peculiar
      structure of these fabulous creatures, as well as of fauns, who somewhat
      resemble them. The theory was started, therefore, that God was overtaken
      by the Sabbath, while he was creating them, and was obliged to postpone
      finishing them till the next day. Hence they are misshapen! The rabbis
      also say that God cut off Adam's tail to make Eve of. The Bible origin of
      woman is low, but this is lower still. However, if Adam exchanged his tail
      for a wife he made a very good bargain, despite the apple and the Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Noah, says the Talmud, could not take the rhinoceros into the ark
      because it was too big. Rabbi Jannai solemnly asserts that he saw a young
      rhinoceros, only a day old, as big as Mount Tabor. Its neck was three
      miles long, its head half a mile, and the river Jordan was choked by its
      excrement. Let us pause at this stretcher, which "stands well for high."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the Christian will join us in laughing at such pious puerilities.
      But he should remember that the Bible is loaded with absurdities that are
      little inferior. Ravens bring a prophet sandwiches, another prophet
      besieges a tile, an axe swims on the water, a man slays a thousand men in
      battle with the jawbone of a donkey, an ass speaks, and a whale swallows
      and vomits a man. Had these pious puerilities occurred in any other book,
      they would have been laughed to scorn; but being in the Bible, they must
      be credited on pain of eternal damnation.

    <h2>
      "THUS SAITH THE LORD."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dogmatism, said Douglas Jerrold, is only puppyism grown to maturity. This
      sarcastic wit never said a truer thing. We call a young fellow a puppy
      when he is conceited and impudent, and we call a man dogmatic when he
      betrays the same qualities in controversy. Yet every Church prides itself
      on being dogmatic. Rome is dogmatic and Canterbury is dogmatic. Without
      dogma there is no theology. And what is dogma? An opinion, or a set of
      opinions, promulgated by somebody for the blind acceptance of somebody
      else. Arrogance, therefore, is of its very essence. What right has one man
      to say to another, "This is the truth; I have taken the trouble to decide
      that point, and all you have to do is to accept what I present you "? And
      if one man has no such right to impose his belief on another, how can
      twenty thousand men have such a right to impose their belief on twenty
      millions? This, however, is precisely what they do without the least shame
      or compunction. Before we are able to judge for ourselves, the priests
      thrust certain dogmas upon us, and compel us to embrace them. Authority
      takes the place of judgment, dogmatism supplants thought. The young mind
      is rendered slavish, and as it grows up it goes through life cringeing to
      the instruments of its own abasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a superior mind rises from this subjection and demands reasons for
      believing, he is knocked down with the Bible. A text is quoted to silence
      him. But who wrote the text? Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Matthew, John, Peter,
      or Paul. Well, and who made them lords over us? Have we not as much right
      to our own thoughts as they had to theirs? When they state an opinion in
      the pompous language of revelation, are they less fallible than the rest
      of us? Obviously not. Yet prophets and evangelists have a trick of
      writing, which still clings to their modern representatives, as though
      they could not be mistaken. "I am Sir Oracle," they seem to say, "and when
      I ope my lips let no dog bark." No doubt this self-conceit is very
      natural, but self-conceited people are not usually taken at their own
      estimate. Nowadays we laugh at them and try to take the conceit out of
      them. But what is absurd to-day is treated as venerable because it
      happened thousands of years ago, and prophets are regarded as inspired
      who, if they existed now, would be treated with ridicule and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of downright God-Almighty-men is very simple. They need not
      argue, they have only to assert, and they preface every statement with
      "Thus saith the Lord." Now suppose such a declaration were made today. A
      man with no greater reputation for sense than his neighbors stands up and
      shouts "Thus saith the Lord." Should we not look at him with curiosity and
      amusement? Would he not strike us as a silly fanatic? Might we not even
      reflect that he was graduating for a strait-waistcoat? The fellow is
      simply an ignorant dogmatist. What he believes you must believe. Reasons
      for his belief he has none, and he cannot conceive that you want any
      either. Yet it would never do to exclaim, "I am your lord and master," so
      the grown-up puppy shouts "Thus saith the Lord," in order to assure you
      that in rejecting him you reject God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we heckle this loud-mouthed preacher for a minute. "You tell us,
      Thus saith the Lord. Did he say so to you, and where and when? And are you
      quite sure you did not dream the whole business?" Probably he answers,
      "No, the Lord did not say it to me, but he said it to the blessed prophets
      and apostles, and I am only repeating their words." "Very well then," a
      sensible man would reply, "you are in the second-hand business, and I want
      new goods. You had better send on the original traders&mdash;Moses,
      Isaiah, Paul and Co.&mdash;and I'll see what I can do with them." If,
      however, the preacher says, "Yes, the Lord did say it to me," a sensible
      man replies, "Well, now, I should have thought the Lord would have told
      somebody with more reputation and influence. Still, what you assert may be
      true. I don't deny it, but at the same time your word is no proof. On the
      whole, I think I'll go my way and let you go yours. The Lord has told you
      something, and you believe it; when he tells me, I'll believe it too. I
      suppose the Lord told you because he wanted you to know, and when he wants
      me to know I suppose he'll give me a call. What you got from him is
      first-hand, what I get from you is second-hand; and, with all due respect,
      I fancy your authority is hardly equal to the Almighty's." "Thus saith the
      Lord" is no argument. It is simply
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The dark lanthorn of the spirit
     Which none can see by but those who bear it.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nay more, it dispenses with reason, and makes every man's faith depend on
      somebody else's authority. Discussion becomes impertinence, criticism is
      high treason. Hence it is but a step from "Thus saith the Lord." Very
      impolite language, truly, yet it is the logical sequence of dogmatism,
      Fortunately the time is nearly past for such impudent nonsense. This is an
      age of debate. And although there are many windy platitudes abroad, and
      much indulgence in empty mouthing, the very fact of debate being
      considered necessary to the settlement of all questions makes the public
      mind less hasty and more cautious. "Thus saith the Lord" men can only
      succeed at present among the intellectual riff-raff of the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking over the past, we see what an immense part dogmatism has played in
      history. "Thus saith the Lord" cried the Jewish prophets, and they not
      only terrified their contemporaries, but overawed a hundred generations.
      "Thus saith the Lord" cried the Christian apostles, and they converted
      thousands of open-mouthed slaves to a "maleficent superstition." "Thus
      saith the Lord" cried Mohammed, and the scimitars of Islam flashed from
      India to Spain. "Thus saith the Lord" cried Joe Smith, and Mormonism
      springs up in the practical West, with its buried gold tablets of
      revelation and its retrogressive polygamy. "Thus saith Reason" has been a
      still small voice, sometimes nearly inaudible, though never quite drowned;
      but now it is swelling into a mighty volume of sound, overwhelming the din
      of sects and the anathemas of priests.

    <h2>
      BELIEVE OR BE DAMNED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christian ministers are showing a disposition to fight shy of the second
      half of the last chapter of Mark, where Jesus is represented as saying to
      his apostles, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
      creature. He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that
      believeth not shall be damned." Some of them tell us to look at the
      Revised Version, where we shall see in the margin that this portion of the
      chapter does not exist in the earliest manuscripts; and they innocently
      expect that Freethinkers will therefore quietly drop the offensive
      passage. Oh dear no! Before they have any right to claim such indulgence
      they must put forth a new edition of the whole Bible, showing us what they
      desire excised, and what they wish to retain and are ready to defend as
      the infallible word of God. We should then discuss whether their selection
      is justifiable, and after that we should discuss whether the amended Bible
      is any diviner than the original one. But we cannot allow them to keep the
      Bible as it is, to call it God's Word, to revile people who doubt it, and
      to persecute people who oppose it; and yet, at the same time, to evade
      responsibility for every awkward text. This will never do. The clergy
      cannot have the authority of inspiration in their pulpits and the ease of
      eclecticism on the platform and in the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, although the text in Mark is the most striking piece of impudent
      bigotry, there are many passages of Holy Writ that display the same
      spirit. The Jews were expressly ordered to kill heretics in this world,
      and the victims only escaped eternal damnation because the chosen people
      knew nothing at that time of future rewards and punishments. A glance at
      the first few pages of <i>Crimes of Christianity</i> will also show that
      the earliest apostles of Christianity were thoroughly imbued with the
      spirit of persecution. Paul smote Elymas with blindness for opposing him,
      and even "the beloved disciple" said "If there come any unto you, and
      bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him
      God speed." Paul tells the Galatians, "If any man preach any other gospel
      unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed." These passages
      plainly imply that the unbeliever is to be shunned like poison, and that
      the teacher of unbelief is a devil. What difference is there between this
      and the passage in Mark? As a matter of fact, all the Christian Churches,
      from the beginning till now, have taught that faith is necessary to
      salvation; and this historic consensus of opinion justifies the
      Freethinker in regarding bigotry as of the essence of the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what is belief? It is an automatic act of the mind, over which the
      will has absolutely no power. The will might, indeed, turn the eyes from
      regarding evidence in a particular direction, or the entire mind from
      attending to the subject at all. But given the evidence before you, and
      your own powers of thought, and your judgment is a logical necessity. You
      cannot help believing what your intellect certifies as true; you cannot
      help disbelieving what your intellect certifies as false. If you were
      threatened with everlasting torment for believing that twice two are four,
      you could not, by the most tremendous effort of volition, alter your
      conviction in the slightest degree. You might be induced to <i>assert</i>
      that twice two are five, but whatever your tongue might utter, your belief
      would remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of threats, therefore, is not to change belief, but to produce
      hypocrisy. Yet this much must be allowed. The threats may succeed <i>if
      they are carried out</i>. Fear will make multitudes <i>profess</i> without
      <i>investigating,</i> and as liars often come to believe their own lies,
      habitual profession produces a state of mind that has a superficial
      resemblance to real belief; and, on the other hand, if the threats of
      future punishment are supplemented by penal laws against heresy, there is
      a process of artificial selection by which independent minds are
      eliminated, while the slavish survive. Even when penal laws are relaxed,
      social ostracism will have a similar, though perhaps a weaker effect.
      Prizes offered to one form of opinion, and losses inflicted on others,
      will necessarily make a difference in their relative success. How slowly
      Christianity advanced during the first three centuries, when it was under
      a cloud! How swiftly it progressed when Constantine gave it wealth and
      privileges, and used the temporal sword to repress or extinguish its
      enemies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is truer than that the religious belief of more than ninety-nine
      hundredths of mankind is determined by the geographical accident of birth.
      Born in Spain they are Catholics; born in England they are Protestants;
      born in Turkey they are Mohammedans; born in India they are Brahmanists;
      born in Ceylon they are Buddhists; born in the shadow of a synagogue they
      are Jews. Their own minds have not the smallest share in deciding their
      faith. They take it at secondhand, as they do their language and their
      fashion of dressing. To call their "faith" belief is absurd. It is simply
      a prejudice. Belief, in the proper sense of the word, follows evidence and
      reflection. What evidence has the ordinary Christian, and has he ever
      reflected on his creed for five minutes in the whole course of his life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophically speaking, men think as they <i>can</i>, and believe as
      they <i>must</i>; and as belief is independent of the will, and cannot be
      affected by motives, it is not a subject for praise or blame, reward or
      punishment. Religions, therefore, which promise heaven for belief and hell
      for unbelief, are utterly unphilosophical. They are self-condemned. Truth
      invites free study. Falsehood shuns investigation, and denounces that
      liberty of thought which is fatal to its pretensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a not too refined, but a very true piece of verse, which was
      first published more than a generation ago in a pungent Freethought
      journal, and we venture to quote its conclusion. After relating the chief
      "flams" of the Bible, it says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And when with this nonsense you're crammed,
     To make you believe it all true,
     They say if you don't you'll be damned;
     But you ought to be damned if you do.

    <h2>
      CHRISTIAN CHARITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jesus Christ told his disciples that, in bestowing alms, they were not
      even to let their left hand know what their right hand did. But this
      self-sacrificing method has not been generally approved, and comparatively
      few Christians "do good by stealth and blush to find it fame." They more
      often "do good for fame and publish it by stealth." Nay more, their
      "charity" is actually their boast in their controversies with "infidels."
      Look at our hospitals, they say; look at our orphanages, look at our
      almshouses, look at our soup-kitchens. It is a wonder they do not boast of
      their asylums, but perhaps they think it would invite the retort that they
      not only build them but fill them. Such boasting, however, is utterly
      absurd from every point of view. Since the world was in any degree
      civilised it has never lacked some kind of benevolent institutions. It is
      absolutely certain that hospitals are not of Christian origin; and there
      is hardly a country in the world, with any pretension to rank above
      barbarians, in which some species of provision is not made by the rich for
      the necessities of the poor. Every Mohammedan, for instance, is required
      by his religion to devote a tenth of his income to charity; whereas the
      Christian system of tithes is entirely for the profit and aggrandisement
      of the clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more ridiculous, if possible, is the Christian cry, "Where are your
      Freethought hospitals, almshouses, and orphanages?" Freethought is a poor,
      struggling cause; its adherents are comparatively few and scattered; it
      has no endowments to lessen the current cost of its propaganda; and it is
      unable to exact subscriptions by the orthodox method of boycotting, or to
      acquire them in return for a good advertisement. Still, the Freethought
      party does manage to relieve its necessitous members; and the
      Freethinkers' Benevolent Fund is not only well supported, in excess of all
      demands, but is probably the <i>only</i> Fund which is administered
      without a single farthing of expense. Besides this, Freethinkers support
      ordinary local charities, when deserving, just like other people; although
      frequently, as in the case of almost every hospital, religion is forced on
      the recipients of such charity, whether they wish it or not, and religious
      tests are maintained in the administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, however, Freethinkers are not inclined to attach so much
      importance as Christians to organised almsgiving. At the best it is but a
      clumsy way of alleviating the worst effects of social disease. The
      Freethinker attaches more importance to the study of causes. He is like
      the true health reformer who believes a great deal more in exercise, fresh
      air, and wholesome diet, than in physic. For this reason Freethinkers are
      generally students of social and political questions. They are Radicals in
      the philosophical sense of the word; that is, they recognise that real,
      lasting improvement can only be achieved by dealing with the causes of
      poverty and degradation. Many Christians, on the other hand, thoroughly
      believe that the poor will never cease out of the land; and they seem to
      regard these unfortunates as whetstones, provided by a beneficent
      providence, on which the wealthy may sharpen their benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian charity, even in its highest form, is infinitely less merciful
      than science; a truth which Mr. Cotter Morison enforces in the seventh
      chapter of his <i>Service of Man</i>. Sanitation, medical science, free
      trade, popular education, co-operation, and such agencies, have done
      tremendously more than religion to diminish evil and mitigate suffering.
      On the other hand, it is indisputable that much of our boasted charity is
      worse than wasted, as it tends to produce the very helplessness and
      pauperism that furnish it with objects of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charity is very good in its way, but what we really want is justice. Let
      us go in for justice first, and when we have got that we shall see what
      remains for charity to do. Probably it will be found that unjust laws
      inflict a hundred times more misery than charity could ever alleviate. If
      that be the case, the most charitable man, after all, is he who devotes
      some of his time, thought, and energy to political and social reform. Good
      health for the next generation is more valuable than medicine for the
      diseases of the present generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charity, also, in its largest sense, is far wider than almsgiving. It is a
      questionable charity which gives you a shilling if you are hard-up, and
      persecutes you if you think for yourself. Most of us do not require
      soup-tickets, but we do require civil treatment, respect for our
      independence, and smiling rather than frowning faces. The man who lifts me
      up from the road when I stumble, deserves my thanks; but I doubt the
      sincerity of his kindness if, when he learns that I honestly differ from
      him on the Atonement, he knocks me down again. Assisting people who agree
      with you, and wilfully injuring those who differ, savors less of charity
      than of zeal. You may be a very good Christian, but I venture to say you
      are a very bad man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Saladin died he ordered charities to be distributed to the poor,
      without distinction of Jew, Christian, or Mohammedan. Yet this brilliant
      ruler had to repel Christian attacks on his dominions, and to witness the
      most abominable cruelty wrought by the soldiers of the Cross. Where, in
      the annals of Christendom, shall we find such a noble example of true
      charity; of charity which overflows the petty barriers of creeds, and
      loses itself in the great ocean of humanity?

    <h2>
      RELIGION AND MONEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Every religion is a getting religion; for though I myself get nothing, I
      am subordinate to those that do. So you may find a lawyer in the Temple
      that gets little for the present; but he is fitting himself to be in time
      one of those great ones that do get."&mdash;Selden's Table Talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Divine stands wrapt up in his cloud of mysteries, and the amused
      Laity must pay Tithes and Veneration to be kept in obscurity, grounding
      their hope of future knowledge on a competent stock of present ignorance."&mdash;George
      Farquhar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion and priestcraft may not be the same thing in <i>essence</i>. That
      is a point on which we do not intend to dogmatise, and this is not the
      opportunity to argue it. But <i>practically</i> religion and priestcraft
      <i>are</i> the same thing. They are inextricably bound up together,. and
      they will suffer a common fate. In saying this, however, we must be
      understood to use the word "religion" in its ordinary sense, as synonymous
      with <i>theology</i>. Religion as non-supernatural, as the idealism of
      morality, the sovereign bond of collective society, is a matter with which
      we are not at present concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priestcraft did not <i>invent</i> religion. To believe that it did is the
      error of an impulsive and uninformed scepticism. But priestcraft developed
      it, systematised it, enforced it, and perpetuated it. This could not be
      effected, however, except in alliance with the temporal power; and
      accordingly, in every country&mdash;savage, barbaric, or civilised&mdash;the
      priests and the privileged classes are found in harmony. They have
      occasional differences, but these are ultimately adjusted. Sometimes the
      priesthood overrules the temporal power, but more frequently the former
      gives way to the latter; indeed, it is instructive to watch how the course
      of religion has been so largely determined by political influences. The
      development of Judaism was almost entirely controlled by the political
      vicissitudes of the Hebrews. The political power really decided the great
      controversy between Arianism and Athanasianism. Politics again, twelve
      hundred years later, settled the bounds of the Reformation, not only for
      the moment, but for subsequent centuries. Where the prince's sword was
      thrown into the scale, it determined the balance. England, for instance,
      was non-papal Catholic under Henry VIII., Protestant under Edward VI.,
      papal-Catholic under Mary, and Protestant again under Elizabeth; although
      every one of these changes, according to the clergy, was dictated by the
      Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests and the privileged classes <i>must</i> settle their differences in
      some way, otherwise the people would become too knowing, and too
      independent. The co-operation of impostor and robber is necessary to the
      bamboozlement and exploitation of the masses. This co-operation, indeed,
      is the great secret of the permanence of religion; and its policy is
      twofold&mdash;education and the power of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of <i>education</i> may be inferred from the frantic efforts of
      the clergy to build and maintain schools of their own, and to force their
      doctrines into the schools built and maintained by the State. In this
      respect there is nothing to choose between Church and Dissent. The reading
      of the Bible in Board schools is a compromise between themselves, lest a
      worse thing should befall them both. If one section were strong enough to
      upset the compromise it would do so; in fact, the Church party is now
      attempting this stroke of policy on the London School Board, with the
      avowed object of giving a Church color to-the religious teaching of the
      children. The very same principle was at work in former days, when none
      but Churchmen were admitted to the universities or public positions. It
      was a splendid means of maintaining the form of religion which was bound
      up with the monarchy and the aristocracy. Learning and influence were, as
      far as possible, kept on the side of the established faith, which thus
      became the master of the masters of the people. This is perfectly obvious
      to the student of history, and Freethinkers should lay its lesson to
      heart. It is only by driving religion entirely out of education, from the
      humblest school to the proudest college, that we shall ever succeed in
      breaking the power of priestcraft and freeing the people from the bondage
      of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could write a volume on this theme&mdash;the power of education in
      maintaining religion; but we must be satisfied with the foregoing at
      present, and turn our attention to the power of <i>money</i>. It is a wise
      adage that money is the sinews of war. Fighting is very largely, often
      wholly, a question of resources. Troops may be ever so brave, generals
      ever so skilful, but they will be beaten unless they have good rifles and
      artillery, plenty of ammunition, and an ample commissariat. Now the same
      thing obtains in <i>all</i> warfare. It would be foolish, no less than
      base, to deny the inspiring efficacy of ideas, the electric force of
      enthusiasm; but, however highly men may be energised, they cannot act
      without instruments; and money buys them, whether the instruments be
      rifles and artillery, or schools, or churches, or any kind of
      organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given churches with great wealth, as well as control over public
      education, and it is easy to see that they will be able to perpetuate
      themselves. Endowments are specially valuable. They are rooted, so to
      speak, in the past, and hold firm. They bear golden fruit to be plucked by
      the skilful and adventurous. Besides, the very age of an endowed
      institution gives it a venerable ora; and its freedom from the full
      necessity of "cadging" lends it a certain "respectability"&mdash;like that
      of a man who lives on his means, instead of earning his living.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not an extravagant calculation that, in England alone, twenty
      millions a year are spent on religion. The figures fall glibly from the
      tongue, but just try to realise them! Think first of a thousand, then of a
      thousand thousand, then of twenty times that. Take a single million, and
      think what its expenditure might do in the shaping of public opinion. A
      practical friend of ours, a good Radical and Freethinker, said that he
      would undertake to create a majority for Home Rule in England with a
      million of money; and if he spent it judiciously, we think he might
      succeed. Well then, just imagine, not one million, but twenty millions,
      spent <i>every year</i> in maintaining and propagating a certain religion.
      Is it not enough, and more than enough, to perpetuate a system which is
      firmly founded, to begin with, on the education of little children?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here lies the strength of Christianity. It is not true, it is not useful.
      Its teachings and pretensions are both seen through by tens of thousands,
      but the wealth supports it. "Without money and without price," is the
      fraudulent language of the pious prospectus. It would never last on those
      terms. The money keeps it up. Withdraw the money, and the Black Army would
      disband, leaving the people free to work out their secular salvation,
      without the fear and trembling of a foolish faith.

    <h2>
      CLOTTED BOSH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "A heterogeneous mass of clotted bosh."
     &mdash;Thomas Carlyle.
</pre>
    <p>
      The death of Tennyson has called forth a vast deal of nonsense. Much of it
      is even insincere. The pulpits have spouted cataracts of sentimentality.
      Some of them have emitted quantities of sheer drivel. A stranger would
      think we had lost our only poet, and well-nigh our only teacher; whereas,
      if the truth must be told, we have lost one who was occasionally a great
      poet, but for the most part a miraculous artist in words. No man in his
      senses&mdash;certainly no man with a spark of judgment&mdash;could call
      Tennyson a profound thinker. Mainly he gave exquisite expression to ideas
      that floated around him. Nor did he possess a high degree of the creative
      faculty, such as Shakespeare possessed in inexhaustible abundance. Surely
      it is possible to admire our dead poet's genius without telling lies over
      his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the pulpit utterances on Tennyson we note the Rev. Hugh Price
      Hughes's as perhaps the very perfection of slobbery incapacity. He appears
      to be delivering a course of addresses on the poet. The first of these
      escaped our attention; the second is before us in the supplement to last
      week's <i>Methodist Times</i>. We have read it with great attention and
      without the slightest profit. Not a sentence or a phrase in it rises above
      commonplace. That a crowd of people should listen to such stuff on a
      Sunday afternoon, when they might be taking a walk or enjoying a snooze,
      is a striking evidence of the degeneration of the human mind, at least in
      the circles of Methodism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes praises Tennyson for "conscientiousness in the use and choice
      of words." He should have said "the choice and use of words," for <i>choice</i>
      must precede <i>use</i> to be of any service. Mr. Hughes says it is of
      great importance that we should all be as conscientious as Tennyson. He
      might as well say it is of great importance that we should all be as
      strong as Sandow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take a few examples of <i>Mr. Hughes's</i> "conscientiousness." He
      talks of "shining features" which "lie upon the very surface" of
      Tennyson's poems. Now features seldom shine, they do not lie, and they
      must be (not <i>upon</i>, but) <i>at</i> the surface. Six lines further
      the shining features change into "shining qualities," as though <i>features</i>
      and <i>qualities</i> were synonyms. Mr. Hughes speaks, in the style of a
      penny-a-liner, of Tennyson's "amazing and unparalleled popular influence."
      Will he tell us if anything could amaze us <i>without</i> being
      unparalleled? He remarks that Tennyson was "not merely and mainly a poet
      of the educated classes." He should have said "merely <i>or</i> mainly."
      He enjoins upon us to "define our terms" and "know the exact meanings of
      the terms we use"&mdash;which is absolute tautology. He says of flirtation&mdash;on
      which he seems an authority&mdash;that "I greatly fear, and am morally
      certain" it is as much perpetrated by men as by women. But if he fears he
      cannot be certain, and if he is certain he cannot fear. He calls duelling
      a form of "insanity and barbarism." But while it may be one or the other,
      it cannot be both at once. The disjunctive, therefore, not the copulative,
      is the proper conjunction. Mr. Hughes misspells the name of Spenser,
      translates <i>mariage de convenance</i> as a marriage of convenience, and
      inserts one of his own inventions in a line of <i>Locksley Hall</i>, which
      runs thus in the Hughes edition of Tennyson&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Puppet to a father's threat and servile to a mother's shrewish tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother's" spoils the line. It is not Tennyson's. Mr. Hughes may claim it&mdash;"an
      ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own." It does equal credit to his
      "conscientiousness" and his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes's style as a critic does not rise to the level of an active
      contempt. Let us look at his matter and see if it shows any superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet although," Mr. Hughes says, with characteristic elegance&mdash;"yet
      although he wrote so much, Tennyson never wrote a single line that would
      bring a painful or anxious blush to the cheek of the most innocent or
      sensitive maiden." What a curious antithesis! Why should a man write
      impurely for writing much? And is <i>this</i> the supreme virtue of a
      great poet? It might be predicated of Martin Tupper. Milton, on the other
      hand, must have made many a maiden rosy by his description of Eve's naked
      loveliness&mdash;to say nothing of the scene after the Fall; while
      Shakespeare must have turned many a maiden cheek scarlet, though we do not
      believe he ever did the maiden any harm. Tennyson was not as free-spoken
      as some poets&mdash;greater poets than himself. But what does Mr. Hughes
      mean by his "Christ-like purity"? Is there a reference here to the twelfth
      verse of the nineteenth chapter of Matthew?
    </p>
    <p>
      Purity, if properly understood, is undoubtedly a virtue. Mr. Hughes
      forgets, however, that his eulogy on Tennyson in this respect is a slur
      upon the Bible. There are things in the Old Testament&mdash;not to mention
      the New Testament&mdash;calculated to make "the most innocent or sensitive
      maiden" vomit; things that might abash a prostitute and make a satyr
      squeamish. We suggest, therefore, that Mr. Hughes should cease canting
      about "purity" while he helps to thrust the Bible into the hands of little
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reward of Tennyson's purity, according to Mr. Hughes, was that "he was
      able to understand women." "The English race," exclaims the eulogist, "has
      never contemplated a nobler or more inspiring womanhood than that which
      glows on every page of Tennyson." This is the hectic exaggeration in which
      Mr. Hughes habitually indulges. Tennyson never drew a live woman. Maud is
      a lay figure, and the heroine of "The Princess" is purely fantastic.
      George Meredith beats the late Laureate hollow in this respect. He is
      second only to Shakespeare, who here, as elsewhere, maintains his
      supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hughes's remarks on <i>Locksley Hall</i> are, to use his own
      expression, amazing. "How terribly," he says, "does he [Tennyson] paint
      the swift degeneration of the faithless Amy." Mr. Hughes forgets&mdash;or
      <i>does</i> he forget?&mdash;that in the sequel to this poem, entitled <i>Sixty
      Years After</i>, Tennyson unsays all the high-pitched dispraise of Amy and
      her squire. <i>Locksley Hall</i> is a piece of splendid versification, but
      the hero is a prig, which is a shade worse than a Philistine. Young
      fellows mouth the poem rapturously; their elders smile at the disguises of
      egotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveless marriage was reprobated by Tennyson, and Mr. Hughes goes into
      ecstacies over the tremendous fact. Like the Psalmist, he is in haste; he
      cannot point to a poet who ever hinted the dethronement of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      A choice Hughesean sentence occurs in this connexion. "I very much
      regret," the preacher says, "that Maud's lover was such a conventional
      idiot that he should have been guilty of the supreme folly of challenging
      her brother to a duel." Shade of Lindley Murrey, what a sentence! A boy
      who wrote thus would deserve whipping. And what right, we ask, has a
      Christian minister to rail at duelling? It was unknown to Greek or Roman
      society. Indeed, it is merely a form of the Ordeal, which was upheld by
      Christianity. The duel was originally a direct and solemn appeal to
      Providence. Only a sceptic has the right to call it a folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough of Mr. Hughes as a stylist, a critic, and teacher. What he really
      shines in is invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story of the converted Atheist shoemaker displays a faculty which has
      no scope in a sermon on Tennyson.

    <h2>
      LORD BACON ON ATHEISM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The pedants will be down upon us for speaking of Lord Bacon. It is true
      there never was such a personage. Francis Bacon was Baron of Verulam,
      Viscount St. Alban, and Lord High Chancellor of England. But this is a
      case in which it is impossible to resist the popular usage. After all, we
      write to be understood. The pedants, the heralds, and all the rest of the
      tribe of technical fanatics, rejoice to mouth "Lord Verulam." But the
      ordinary man of letters, like the common run of readers, will continue to
      speak of Lord Bacon; for Bacon was his name, and the "Lord" was but a
      pretty feather in his hat. And when his lordship took that splendid pen of
      his, to jot down some of his profoundest thoughts for posterity, did he
      not say in his grand style, "I, Francis Bacon, thought on this wise"? You
      cannot get the "Bacon" out of it, and as the "Lord" will slip in, we must
      let it stand as Lord Bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon was was a very great man. Who does not remember Pope's lines?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shined,
     The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.
</pre>
    <p>
      But his hardship was fond of wielding the satiric lash, and that spirit
      leads to exaggeration. Bacon was not the meanest of mankind, Pope himself
      did things that Bacon would never have stooped to. Nor was Bacon the
      wisest and brightest of mankind. A wiser and brighter spirit was
      contemporary with him in the person of "a poor player." The dullards who
      fancy that Lord Bacon wrote the plays of Shakespeare have no
      discrimination. His lordship's mind might have been cut out of the poet's
      without leaving an incurable wound. Some will dissent from this, but be it
      as it may, the <i>styles</i> of the two men are vastly different, like
      their ways of thinking. Bacon's essay on Love is cynical. The man of the
      world, the well-bred statesman, looked on Love as "the child of folly," a
      necessary nuisance, a tragi-comical perturbation. Shakespeare saw in Love
      the mainspring of life. Love speaks "in a perpetual hyperbole," said
      Bacon. Shakespeare also said that the lover "sees Helen's beauty in a brow
      of Egypt," The poet knew all the philosopher knew, and more. What Bacon
      laughed or sneered at, Shakespeare recognised as the magic of the great
      enchanter, who touches our imaginations and kindles in us the power of the
      ideal. Exaggeration there must be in passion and imagination; it is the
      defect of their quality; but what are we without them? Dead driftwood on
      the tide; dismantled hulls rotting in harbor; anything that awaits
      destruction, to give its imprisoned forces a chance of asserting
      themselves in new forms of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon was not a Shakespeare; still, he was a very great man. His writings
      are a text-book of worldly wisdom. His philosophical force is almost
      proverbial. Nor was he wanting in a certain "dry" poetry. No philosophical
      writer, not even Plato, equals him in the command of illuminative
      metaphors; and the fine dignity of his style is beyond all praise. The
      words drop from his pen with exquisite ease and felicity. He is never in a
      hurry, never ruffled. He writes like a Lord Chancellor, though with
      something in him above the office; and if he is now and then familiar, it
      is only a slight condescension, like the joke of a judge, which does not
      bring him down to the level of the litigants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinions of such a man are worth studying; and as Lord Bacon is often
      quoted in condemnation of Atheism, we propose to see what he actually says
      about it, what his judgment on this particular theme is really worth, and
      what allowance, if any, should be made for the conditions in which he
      expressed himself. This last point, indeed, is one of considerable
      importance. Lord Bacon lived at a time when downright heresy, such as
      Raleigh and other great men of that age were accused of, could only be
      ventilated in private conversation. In writing it could only be hinted or
      suggested; and, in this respect, a writer's <i>silence</i> is to be taken
      into account; that is, we must judge by what he does <i>not</i> say, as
      well as by what he <i>does</i> say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some writers, like Letourneau, the French ethnologist, have gone to the
      length of arguing that Lord Bacon was a Materialist, and that his Theistic
      utterances were all perfunctory: as it were, the pinch of incense which
      the philosopher was obliged to burn on the altars of the gods. This much
      at least is certain&mdash;Lord Bacon rarely speaks of religion except as a
      philosopher or a statesman. He is apt to sneer at the "high speculations"
      of "theologues." There is no piety, no unction, in his allusions to
      theology. He looks upon religion as a social bond, an agency of good
      government. It is impossible to say that he took a Christian view of
      things when he wrote, "I have often thought upon Death, and I find it the
      least of all evils"; or when he wrote, "Men fear death as children fear to
      go into the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with
      tales, so is the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon has an essay on Atheism, which is significantly followed by
      another on Superstition. The latter is seldom referred to by religious
      apologists, but we shall deal with it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all superstition," he says, "wise men follow fools." This is a bold,
      significant utterance. Fools are always in the majority, wise men are few,
      and they are obliged to bow to the power of the multitude. Kings respect,
      and priests organise, the popular folly; and the wise men have to sit
      aloft and nod to each other across the centuries. There is a freemasonry
      amongst them, and they have their shibboleths and dark sayings, to protect
      them against priests and mobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the story of Balaam is a subtle anticipation of Lord Bacon's
      dictum. It was the ass that first saw the angel. Baalam only saw it
      afterwards, when his wits were disordered by the wonder of a talking
      donkey. Thus the prophet followed the ass, as wise men follow fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superstition is worse than Atheism, in Lord Bacon's judgment; the one is
      unbelief, he says, but the other is contumely; and "it were better to have
      no opinion of God at all, than such an opinion as is unworthy of him." He
      approves the saying of Plutarch, that he "had rather a great deal men
      should say there was no such man as Plutarch, than that they should say
      there was one Plutarch that would eat his children as soon as they were
      born"&mdash;which, on the part of Lord Bacon, looks like a thrust at the
      doctrine of original sin and infant damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his keen eye for "the good of man's estate," Lord Bacon remarks of
      superstition, that "as the contumely is greater towards God, so the danger
      is greater towards men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws,
      to reputation; all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, though
      religion were not; but superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an
      absolute monarchy in the minds of men; therefore Atheism did never perturb
      states; for it makes men wary of themselves, as looking no farther, and we
      see the times inclined to Atheism (as the time of Augustus Caesar) were
      civil times; but superstition hath been the confusion of many states, and
      bringeth in a new <i>primum mobile</i> that ravisheth all the spheres of
      government."
    </p>
    <p>
      By "civil times" Lord Bacon means settled, quiet, orderly, progressive
      times&mdash;times of civilisation. And it is rather singular that he
      should pick out the age immediately preceding the advent of Christianity.
      Whatever fault is in Atheism, it is no danger to human society. This is
      Lord Bacon's judgment, and we commend it to the attention of the fanatics
      of faith, who point to Atheism as a horrid monster, fraught with cruelty,
      bloodshed, and social disruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming now to Lord Bacon's essay on Atheism itself, we find him opening it
      with a very pointed utterance of Theism. "I had rather," he says, "believe
      all the fables in the legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that
      this universal frame is without a mind." The expression is admirable, but
      the philosophy is doubtful. When a man says he would <i>rather</i> believe
      one thing than another, he is merely exhibiting a personal preference.
      Real belief is not a matter of taste; it is determined by evidence&mdash;if
      not absolutely, at least as far as our power of judgment carries us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little philosophy," his lordship says, "inclineth man's mind to
      Atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."
      The reason he assigns is, that when we no longer rest in second causes,
      but behold "the chain of them confederate, and linked together," we must
      needs "fly to providence and Deity." The necessity, however, is far from
      obvious. All the laws, as we call them, of all the sciences together, do
      not contain any new principle in their addition. Universal order is as
      consistent with Materialism as with Theism. It is easy to say that "God
      never wrought miracles to convince Atheism, because his ordinary works
      convince it"; but, as a matter of fact, it is the God of Miracles in whom
      the multitude have always believed. A special providence, rather than a
      study of the universe, has been the secret of their devotion to "the
      unseen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon drops below the proper level of his genius in affirming that
      "none deny there is a God, but those for whom it maketh that there were no
      God." This is but a milder expression of the incivility of the Psalmist.
      It is finely rebuked by the atheist Monk in the play of "Sir William
      Crichton," the work of a man of great though little recognised genius&mdash;William
      Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ye who deem that one who lacks of faith Is therefore conscience-free,
      ye little know How doubt and sad denial may enthral him To the most timid
      sanctity of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon, indeed, rather doubts the existence of the positive Atheist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appeareth in nothing more, that Atheism is rather in the lip than in
      the heart of man, than by this, that Atheists will ever be talking of that
      their opinion, as if they fainted in it within themselves, and would be
      glad to be strengthened by the opinion of others: nay more, you shall have
      Atheists strive to get disciples, as it fareth with other sects; and,
      which is most of all, you shall have of them that will suffer for Atheism,
      and not recant; whereas, if they truly think that there is no such thing
      as God, Why should they trouble themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Lord Bacon was not the "meanest of mankind," there was certainly
      a lack of the heroic in his disposition; and this passage emanated from
      the most prosaic part of his mind and character. "Great thoughts," said
      Vauvenargues, "spring from the heart." Now the heart of Lord Bacon was not
      as high as his intellect; no one could for a moment imagine his facing
      martyrdom. He had none of the splendid audacity, the undaunted courage,
      the unshakable fortitude, of his loftier contemporary, Giordano Bruno. So
      much truth is there in Pope's epigram, that his lordship was capable at
      times of grovelling; witness his fulsome, though magnificent, dedication
      of the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> to King James&mdash;the British
      Solomon, as his flatterers called him, to the amusement of the great Henry
      of France, who sneered, "Yes, Solomon the son of David," in allusion to
      his mother's familiarity with David Rizzio. And in this very passage of
      the essay on Atheism we also see the grovelling side of Lord Bacon, with a
      corresponding perversion of intelligence. Being incapable of understanding
      martyrdom, except under the expectation of a reward in heaven, his
      lordship cannot appreciate the act of an Atheist in suffering for his
      convictions. His concluding words are positively <i>mean</i>. Surely the
      Atheist might trouble himself about truth, justice, and dignity; all of
      which are involved in the maintenance and propagation of his principles.
      But, if the closing observation is mean, the opening observation is
      fatuous. This is a strong word to use of any sentence of Lord Bacon's, but
      in this instance it is justifiable. If an Atheist mistrusts his own
      opinion, because he talks about it, what is to be said of the Christians,
      who pay thousands of ministers to talk about their opinions, and even
      subscribe for Missionary Societies to talk about them to the "heathen"?
      Are we to conclude that an Atheist's talking shows mistrust, and a
      Christian's talking shows confidence? What real weakness is there in the
      Atheist's seeking for sympathy and concurrence? It is hard for any man to
      stand alone; certainly it was not in Lord Bacon's line to do so; and why
      should not the Atheist be "glad to be strengthened by the opinion of
      others"! Novalis said that his opinion gained infinitely when it was
      shared by another. The participation does not prove the truth of the
      opinion, but redeems it from the suspicion of being a mere maggot of an
      individual brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon then turns to the barbaric races, who worship particular gods,
      though they have not the general name; a fact which he did not understand.
      More than two hundred years later it was explained by David Hume. It is
      simply a proof that monotheism grows out of polytheism; or, if you like,
      that Theism is a development of Idolatry. This is a truth that takes all
      the sting out of Lord Bacon's observation that "against Atheists the very
      savages take part with the very subtilest philosophers." We may just
      remark that the philosophers must be very hard pressed when they call up
      their savage allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemplative Atheists are rare, says Lord Bacon&mdash;"a Diagoras, a
      Bion, a Lucian perhaps, and some others." They seem more than they are,
      for all sorts of heretics are branded as Atheists; which leads his
      lordship to the declaration that "the great Atheists indeed are
      hypocrites, which are ever handling holy things, but without feeling; so
      as they must needs be cauterised in the end." This is a pungent
      observation, and it springs from the better side of his lordship's nature.
      We also have no respect for hypocrites, and for that very reason we object
      to them as a present to Atheism. Religion must consume in its own smoke,
      and dispose of its own refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The causes of Atheism next occupy Lord Bacon's attention. He finds they
      are four; divisions in religion, the scandal of priests, profane scoffing
      in holy matters, and "learned times, especially with peace and
      prosperity." "Troubles and adversities," his lordship says, "do more bow
      men's minds to religion." Which is true enough, though it only illustrates
      the line of the Roman poet that religion always has its root in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be observed that, up to the present, Lord Bacon has not considered
      one of the reasons <i>for</i> Atheism. What he calls "causes" are only <i>occasions</i>.
      He does not discuss, or even refer to, the objections to Theism that are
      derived from the tentative operations of nature, so different from what
      might be expected from a settled plan; from ugly, venomous and monstrous
      things; from the great imperfection of nature's very highest productions;
      from the ignorance, misery, and degradation of such a vast part of
      mankind; from the utter absence of anything like a moral government of the
      universe. Only towards the end of his essay does Lord Bacon begin business
      with the Atheists. "They that deny a God," he says, "destroy a man's
      nobility; for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body; and, if
      he be not of kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature."
      This is pointed and vigorous, but after all it is a matter of sentiment.
      Some prefer the fallen angel, others the risen ape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon, like Earl Beaconsfield, is on the side of the angels. We are
      on the other side. A being who has done something, and will do more,
      however humble his origin, is preferable to one who can only boast of his
      fine descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, his lordship takes the illustration of the dog, to whom man is
      "instead of a God." What generosity and courage he will put on, in the
      "confidence of a better nature than his own." So man gathereth force and
      faith from divine protection and favor. Atheism therefore "depriveth human
      nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty." But this is to
      forget that there may be more than one means to the same end. Human nature
      may be exalted above its frailty without becoming the dog of a superior
      intelligence. Science, self-examination, culture, public opinion, and the
      growth of humanity, are more than substitutes for devotion to a deity.
      They are capable of exalting man continuously and indefinitely. They do
      not appeal to the spaniel element in his nature; they make him free,
      erect, noble, and self-dependent.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole we are bound to say that Lord Bacon's essay on Atheism is
      unworthy of his genius. If it were the only piece of his writing extant,
      we should say it was the work of one who had great powers of expression
      but no remarkable powers of thought. He writes very finely as a strong
      advocate, putting a case in a way that commands attention, and perhaps
      admiration for its force and skill. But something more than this is to be
      expected when a really great man addresses himself to a question of such
      depth and importance. What then are we to conclude? Why this, that Lord
      Bacon dared not give the rein to his mind in an essay on Atheism. He was
      bound to be circumspect in a composition level to the intelligence of
      every educated reader. We prefer to take him where he enjoys greater
      freedom. Under the veil of a story, for instance, he aims a dart at the
      superstition of a special providence, which is an ineradicable part of the
      Christian faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bion, the Atheist, being shown the votive tablets in the temple of
      Neptune, presented by those who prayed to the god in a storm and were
      saved, asked where were the tablets of those who were drowned. Bacon tells
      the story with evident gusto, and it is in such things that we seem to get
      at his real thoughts. In a set essay on Atheism, a man of his worldly
      wisdom, and un-heroic temper, was sure to kneel at the regular altars. The
      single query "Why should they trouble themselves?" explains it all.

      CHRISTIANITY AND SLAVERY. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Christianity and Slavery. No. 18 of Oxford House Papers.
     By H. Henley Henson, B.A., Head of the Oxford House in
     Bethnal Green. London: Rivingtons.
</pre>
    <p>
      Some time ago I delivered a lecture in the London Hall of Science on
      "Christianity and Slavery." Among my critics there was one gentleman, and
      the circumstance was so noteworthy that my friend the chairman expressed a
      wish, which I cordially echoed, that we might have the pleasure of hearing
      him again. A few days ago a pamphlet reached me on the subject of that
      lecture, written by my friendly opponent, who turns out to be the head of
      the Oxford House in Bethnal Green. Mr. Henson sends me the pamphlet
      himself "with his compliments," and I have read it carefully. Indeed, I
      have marked it in dozens of places where his statements strike me as
      inaccurate and his arguments as fallacious; and, on the whole, I think it
      best to give him a set answer in this journal. Mr. Henson's paper is not,
      in my opinion, a very forcible one on the intellectual side. But perhaps
      that is, in a certain sense, one of its merits; for the Christian case in
      this dispute is so bad that sentiment does it more service than logic. I
      must, however, allow that Mr. Henson is a courteous disputant, and I hope
      I shall reciprocate his good feeling. When he opposed me at the Hall of
      Science, he admits that I treated him "with a courtesy which relieves
      controversy of its worst aspects." I trust he will be equally satisfied
      with my rejoinder. Whenever I may have occasion to express myself
      strongly, I shall simply be in earnest about the theme, without the least
      intention of being discourteous. I mean no offence, and I hope I shall
      give none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson says he is dealing in a brief compass with a big subject, but
      "the outlines are clear, and may be perceived very readily by any honest
      man of moderate intelligence." Well, whether it is that I am not an honest
      man, or that I possess immoderate intelligence, I certainly do not see the
      outlines of the subject as Mr. Henson sees them. The relation of
      Christianity to slavery is an historical question, and Mr. Henson treats
      it as though it were one of dialectics. However, I suppose I had better
      follow him, and show that he is wrong even on his own ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson undertakes to prove three things. (1) That slavery is flatly
      opposed to the teaching of the New Testament. (2) That the abolition of
      slavery in Europe was mainly owing to Christianity. (3) That at this
      present time Christianity is steadily working against slavery all over the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I discuss the first proposition I must ask why the <i>Old</i>
      Testament is left out of account. Mr. Henson relegates it to a footnote,
      and there he declares "once for all, that the Mosaic Law has nothing to do
      with the question." But Mr. Henson's "once for all" has not the force of a
      Papal decree. It is simply a bit of rhetorical emphasis, like a flourish
      to a signature. Does he mean to say that the author of the Mosaic Law was
      not the same God who speaks to us in the New Testament? If it was the same
      God, "the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever," the Mosaic Law has very
      much to do with the question; unless&mdash;and this is a vital point&mdash;Jesus
      distinctly abrogates it in any respect. He <i>did</i> distinctly abrogate
      the <i>lex talionis</i>, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; but he
      left the laws of slavery exactly as he found them, and in this he was
      followed by Peter and Paul, and by all the Fathers of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson tells us that "the Jews were a barbarous race, and slavery was
      necessary to that stage of development," and that "the Law of Moses
      moderated the worst features of slavery." The second statement cannot be
      discussed, for we do not know what was the condition of slavery among the
      Jews before the so-called Mosaic Law (centuries after Moses) came into
      vogue. The first statement, however, is perfectly true; the Jews <i>were</i>
      barbarous, and slavery among them was inevitable. But that is speaking <i>humanly</i>.
      What is the use of God's interference if he does not make people wiser and
      better? Why did he lay down slavery laws without hinting that they were
      provisional? Why did he so express himself as to enable Christian divines
      and whole Churches to justify slavery from the Bible long after it had
      died out of the internal polity of civilised states? Surely God might have
      given less time to Aaron's vestments and the paraphernalia of his own
      Tabernacle, and devoted some of his infinite leisure to teaching the Jews
      that property in human flesh and blood is immoral. Instead of that he
      actually told them, not only how to buy foreigners (Leviticus xxv. 45,
      46), but how to enslave their own brethren (Exodus xxi. 2-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jesus Christ came from heaven to give mankind a new revelation he had
      a fine opportunity to correct the brutalities of the Mosaic Law. Yet Mr.
      Henson allows that he "did not actually forbid Slavery in express terms,"
      and that he "never said in so many words, Slavery is wrong." But why not?
      It will not do to say the time was not ripe, for Mr. Henson admits that in
      Rome "the fashionable philosophies, especially that of the Stoics, branded
      Slavery as an outrage against the natural Equality of Men." Surely Jesus
      Christ might have kept abreast of the Stoics. Surely, too, as he did not
      mean to say anything more for at least two thousand years, he might have
      gone <i>in advance</i> of the best teaching of the age, so as to provide
      for the progress of future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, says Mr. Henson, Jesus Christ "laid down broad principles which took
      from Slavery its bad features, and tended, by an unerring law to its
      abolition." Well, the tendency was a remarkably slow one. Men still living
      can remember when Slavery was abolished in the British dominions. I can
      remember when it was abolished in the United States. Eighteen centuries of
      Christian <i>tendency</i> were necessary to kill Slavery! Surely the
      natural growth of civilisation might have done as much in that time,
      though Jesus Christ had never lived and taught. How civilisation <i>did</i>
      mitigate the horrors of Slavery, and was gradually but surely working
      towards its abolition, may be seen in Gibbon's second chapter. This was
      under the great Pagan emperors, some of whom knew Christianity and
      despised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slavery is cruel," says Mr. Henson, while "Christianity teaches men to be
      kind and to love one another." But <i>teaching</i> men to love one
      another, even if Christianity taught nothing else&mdash;which is far from
      the truth&mdash;is a very questionable expenditure of time and energy; for
      how is love to be <i>taught</i>? Besides, a master and a slave might be
      attached to each other&mdash;as was often the case&mdash;without either
      seeing that Slavery was a violation of the law of love. What was needed
      was the sentiment of <i>Justice</i>. That has broken the chains of the
      slave. The Stoics were on the right track after all, while Christianity
      lost itself in idle sentimentalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slavery denies the Equality of Men," says Mr. Henson, while "Christianity
      asserts it strongly." I regret I cannot agree with him. Certain amiable
      texts which he cites might easily be confronted with others of a very
      different character. What did Christ mean by promising that when he came
      into his kingdom his disciples should sit on twelve thrones judging the
      twelve tribes of Israel? How is this consistent with his saying, "call no
      man master"? What did Paul mean by ordering unlimited obedience to "the
      powers that be"? What did he and Peter mean by telling slaves to obey
      their owners? Is all this consistent with the doctrine of human equality?
      Mr. Henson simply reads into certain New Testament utterances what was
      never in the speakers' minds. His abstract argument is indeed perilous in
      regard to such composite writings as the Gospels and the Epistles. Let it
      be assumed, for argument's sake, that Christianity does somewhere assert
      the Equality of Men. Then it condemns Royalty as well as Slavery; yet
      Peter says, "Fear God and honor the King." I leave Mr. Henson to extricate
      himself from this dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat that all this dialectic is a kind of subterfuge; at least it is
      an evasion. The great fact remains that Jesus Christ never breathed a
      whisper against slavery when he had the opportunity. Yet he could denounce
      what he disapproved in the most vigorous fashion. His objurgation of the
      Scribes and Pharisees is almost without a parallel. Surely he might have
      reserved a little of his boisterous abuse for an institution which was
      infinitely more harmful than the whole crowd of his rivals. Those who
      opposed <i>him</i> were overwhelmed with vituperation, but not once did he
      censure those who held millions in cruel bondage, turning men into mere
      beasts of burden, and women, if they happened to be beautiful, into the
      most wretched victims of lust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now turn to Paul, the great apostle whose teaching has had more
      influence on the faith and practice of Christendom than that of Jesus
      himself. Mr. Henson says that "the Apostle does not say one word for or
      against slavery as such." Again I regret to differ. Paul never said a word
      <i>against</i> slavery, but he said many words that sanctioned it by
      implication. He tells slaves (<i>servants</i> in the Authorised Version)
      to count their owners worthy of all honor (1 Tim. vi. 1); to be obedient
      unto them, with fear and trembling, as unto Christ (Ephesians vi. 5); and
      to please them in all things (Titus ii. 9). I need not discuss whether
      servants means <i>slaves</i> and masters <i>owners</i>, for Mr. Henson
      admits that such is their meaning. Here then Paul is, if Jesus was not,
      brought face to face with slavery, and he does not even suggest that the
      institution is wrong. He tells slaves to obey their owners as they obey
      Christ; and, on the other hand, he bids owners to "forbear threatening"
      their slaves. But so much might have been said by Cicero and Pliny; the
      former of whom, as Lecky says, wrote many letters to his slave Tiro "in
      terms of sincere and delicate friendship"; while the latter "poured out
      his deep sorrow for the death of some of his slaves, and endeavored to
      console himself with the thought that as he had emancipated them before
      their death, they had at least died free men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul does indeed say that both bond and free are "all one in Christ." But
      Louis the Fourteenth would have admitted <i>that</i> kinship between
      himself and the meanest serf in France, "One in Christ" is a spiritual
      idea, and has relation to a future life, in which earthly distinctions
      would naturally cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson is obliged to face the story of Onesimus, the runaway slave,
      whom Paul deliberately sent back to his master, Philemon. "The Apostle's
      position," he says, "is practically this"; whereupon he puts into Paul's
      mouth words of his own invention. I do not deny his right to use this
      literary artifice, but I decline to let it impose on my own understanding.
      There is a certain pathetic tenderness in Paul's letter to Philemon if we
      suppose that he took the institution of Slavery for granted, but it
      vanishes if we suppose that he felt the institution to be wrong. Professor
      Newman justly remarks that "Onesimus, in the very act of taking to flight,
      showed that he had been submitting to servitude against his will, and that
      the house of his owner had previously been a prison to him." Nor do I see
      any escape from the same writer's conclusion that, although Paul besought
      Philemon to treat Onesimus as a brother, "this very recommendation, full
      of affection as it is, virtually recognises the moral rights of Philemon
      to the services of his slave." Mr. Benson apparently feels this himself.
      "Christian tradition," he says, "declares that Philemon at once set
      Onesimus free." But "tradition" can hardly be cited as a fact. Mr. Henson
      says "it is more than probable," or, in other words, <i>certain</i>; yet
      he cannot expect me to follow him in his illogical leap. Nor, indeed, is
      the "traditional" liberation of Onesimus of much importance to the
      argument. Not Philemon's but Paul's views are in dispute; and if Philemon
      did liberate Onesimus&mdash;which is a pure assumption&mdash;Paul
      certainly did not advise him to do anything of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul's epistle to Philemon does not, from its very-nature, seem intended
      for publication. Why then, in the ease of private correspondence, did he
      not hint that Slavery was only tolerated for the time and would eventually
      cease? Instead of that he sent back Onesimus to a servitude from which he
      had fled. How unlike Theodore Parker writing his discourse, with a runaway
      slave in the back room, and a revolver on his desk! How unlike Walt
      Whitman watching the slumber of another fugitive, with one hand on his
      trusty rifle!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson lives after the abolition of Slavery, and as he clings to his
      Bible as God's Word he reads into it the morality of a later age. Let him
      consult the writings of Christian divines on the subject, and he will see
      that they have almost invariably justified Slavery from scripture.
      Ignatius (who is said to have seen Jesus), St. Cyprian, Pope Gregory the
      Great, St. Basil, Tertullian, St. Isidore, St. Augustine, St. Bernard, St.
      Thomas Aquinas, and Bossuet, all taught that Slavery is a divine
      institution. During all the centuries from Ignatius to Bossuet, what
      eminent Christian ever denounced Slavery as wicked? Even the Christian
      jurisprudists of the eighteenth century defended negro slavery, which it
      was reserved for the sceptical Montesquieu and the arch-heretic Voltaire
      to condemn. Montesquieu's ironical chapter on the subject is worthy of
      Molliere, and Voltaire's is an honor to humanity. He called Slavery "the
      degrada of the species"; and, in answer to Puffendorff, who claimed that
      slavery had been established by the free consent of the opposing parties,
      he exclaimed, "I will believe Puffendorff, when he shows me the original
      contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      Negro slavery was defended in America by direct appeal to the Bible. Mr.
      Henson seeks to lessen the force of this damning fact by referring to
      these defenders of slavery as "certain clergymen and other Christians,"
      and as "ignorant and unworthy members of the Church." <i>Certain</i>
      clergymen! Why, the clergy defended slavery almost to a man, and in the
      Northern States they were even more bigoted than in the South. Mrs.
      Beecher Stowe said that the Church was so familiarly quoted as being on
      the side of Slavery, that "Statesmen on both sides of the question have
      laid that down as a settled fact." Theodore Parker said that if the whole
      American Church had "dropped through the continent and disappeared
      altogether, the anti-Slavery cause would have been further on." He pointed
      out that no Church ever issued a single tract, among all its thousands,
      against property in human flesh and blood; and that 80,000 slaves were
      owned by Presbyterians, 225,000 by Baptists, and 250,000 by Methodists.
      Wilberforce himself declared that the American Episcopal Church "raises no
      voice against the predominant evil; she palliates it in theory, and in
      practice she shares in it. The mildest and most conscientious of the
      bishops of the South are slaveholders themselves." The Harmony Presbytery
      of South Carolina deliberately resolved that Slavery was justified by Holy
      Writ. The Methodist Episcopal Church decided in 1840 against allowing any
      "colored persons" to give testimony against "white persons." The College
      Church of the Union Theological Seminary, Prince Edward County, was
      endowed with slaves, who were hired out to the highest bidder for the
      pastor's salary. Lastly, Professor Moses Stuart, of Andover, who is
      accounted the greatest American theologian since Jonathan Edwards,
      declared that "The precepts of the New Testament respecting the demeanor
      of slaves and their masters beyond all question recognise the existence of
      Slavery." So much for Mr. Henson's "certain clergymen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson also argues that the Northern States were "the most distinctly
      Christian," and that they were opposed to Slavery. History belies this
      statement Harriet Martineau, when she visited America and stood on the
      anti-slavery platform, says she was in danger of her life in the North
      while scarcely molested in the South. When William Lloyd Garrison
      delivered his first anti-slavery lecture in Boston, the classic home of
      American orthodoxy, every Catholic and Protestant church was closed
      against him, and he was obliged to accept the use of Julian Hall from
      Abner Kneeland, an infidel who had been prosecuted for blasphemy. It was
      not "the true spirit of Christianity" which abolished Slavery in the
      United States, but "the true spirit of Humanity," which inspired some
      Christians and more Freethinkers to vindicate the natural rights of men of
      all colors. Even in the end, Slavery was not terminated by the vote of the
      Churches; it was abolished by Lincoln as a strategic act in the midst of a
      civil war, precisely as was predicted by Thomas Paine, who not only hated
      Slavery while his Christian defamers lived by it, but was more sagacious
      in his political forecast than all the orthodox statesmen of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A movement headed by Clarkson and Wilberforce," says Mr. Henson, "could
      be no other than Christian," But why? Were not the slave-owners also
      Christians? Was not the strength of Freethinkers, from Jeremy Bentham
      downwards, given to the abolition movement? Were not the Freethinkers all
      on one side, while the Christians were divided? And why did the abolition
      movement in England wait until new ideas had leavened the public mind? Had
      it been purely Christian, would it not have triumphed long before? The
      fact is there was plenty of Christianity during the preceding thousand
      years, but the sceptical and humanitarian work of the eighteenth century
      was necessary before there could be any general revolt against injustice
      and oppression. No perversion of history can alter the fact that, in the
      words of Professor Newman, "the first public act against Slavery came from
      republican France, in the madness of atheistic enthusiasm." Mr. Henson
      sees this clearly himself, and therefore he pretends that all the best
      ideas of the French Revolution were borrowed from Christianity. Shades of
      Voltaire and Diderot, of Mirabeau and Danton, listen to this apologist of
      the faith you despised! Voltaire's face is wreathed with ineffable irony,
      Diderot contemplates the speaker as a new species for a psychological
      monograph, Mirabeau flings back his leonine head with a swirl of the black
      mane and a glare of the great eyes, and Danton roars a titanic laugh that
      shakes the very roof of Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us turn to the old indigenous Slavery of Europe. Mr. Henson
      appeals to "the witness of history," and he shall have it. He undertakes
      to prove "That among the various causes which tended to assuage the
      hardship and threaten the permanence of Slavery, the most powerful, the
      most active, and most successful was Christianity"; also "That when the
      barbarian conquests re-established slavery in a new form, the Church
      exerted all her energies on the side of freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      That Christianity "threatened" the permanence of Slavery is, of course,
      purely a matter of opinion. Mr. Henson takes one view, I have given
      reasons for another, and the reader must judge between us. That it
      softened the rigors of Slavery is a very questionable statement. When Mr.
      Henson says that "Roman Slavery was, perhaps, the most cruel and revolting
      kind of Slavery," he is guilty of historical confusion. Roman Slavery
      lasted for very many centuries. In the early ages it was brutal enough,
      but under the great emperors, and especially the Antonines, it was far
      more merciful than negro Slavery was in Christian America. Slaves were
      protected by law; the power of putting them to death was taken from the
      masters and entrusted to the magistrates; and, as Gibbon says, "Upon a
      just complaint of intolerable treatment, the injured slave either obtained
      his deliverance or a less cruel master." Compare this with the condition
      of serfs under the Christian feudal system, when, in Mr. Henson's own
      language, "the serf was tied to the soil, bought and sold with it, the
      chattel of his master, who could overwork, beat, and even kill him at
      will."
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase "re-established Slavery in a new form," seems to imply that
      Christianity had abolished Slavery before the barbaric conquests. But it
      had done nothing of the kind. Nay, as a matter of fact, Constantine and
      his successors drew a sharper line than ever between slaves and freemen.
      Constantine (the first Christian emperor) actually decreed death against
      any freewoman who should marry a slave, while the slave himself was to be
      burnt alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of what Mr. Henson says about the manumission of slaves by some of
      the mediaeval clergy is unquestionably true. But who doubts that, during a
      thousand years, a humane and even a noble heart often beat under a
      priest's cassock? These manumissions, however, were of Christian slaves.
      The Pagan slaves&mdash;such as the Sclavonians, from whom the word <i>slave</i>
      is derived&mdash;were considered to have no claims at all. Surely the
      liberation of fellow Christians might spring from proselyte zeal.
      "Mohammedans also," as Professor Newman says, "have a conscience against
      enslaving Mohammedans, and generally bestow freedom on a slave as soon as
      he adopts their religion." Manumission of slaves was common among humane
      owners under the Roman Empire; indeed Gibbon observes that the law had to
      guard against the swamping of free citizens by the sudden inrush of "a
      mean and promiscuous multitude." Clerical manumission of slaves in
      mediaeval times was therefore no novelty. On the other hand, bishops held
      slaves like kings and nobles. The Abbey of St. Germain de Pres, for
      instance, owned 80,000 slaves, and the Abbey of St. Martin de Tours
      20,000. The monks, who according to Mr. Henson, did so much to extinguish
      slavery, owned multitudes of these servile creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acts of a few humane and noble spirits are no test of the effects of a
      system. The decisions of Church Councils are a much better criterion. They
      show the influence of <i>principles</i>, when personal equation is
      eliminated. Turning to these Councils, then, what do we find? Why that
      from the Council of Laodicea to the Lateran Council (1215)&mdash;that is,
      for eight hundred years&mdash;the Church sanctioned Slavery again and
      again. Slaves and their owners might be "one in Christ," but the Church
      taught them to keep their distance on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civilisation, not Christianity, gradually extinguished Slavery in Europe.
      Foreign slavery, such as that in our West Indian possessions, is an
      artificial thing, and may be abolished by the stroke of a pen. But
      domestic slavery has to die a natural death. The progress of education and
      refinement, and the growth of the sentiment of justice, help to extinguish
      it; but behind these there is an economical law which is no less potent.
      Slave labor is only consistent with a low industrial life; and thus, as
      civilisation expands, slavery fades into serfdom, and serfdom into
      wage-service, as naturally as the darkness of night melts into the morning
      twilight, and the twilight into day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henson throws in some not ineloquent remarks about the abolition by
      Christianity of the gladiatorial shows at Rome. He himself has stood
      within the ruined Colosseum and re-echoed Byron's heroics. Mr. Henson even
      outdid Byron, for he looked up to the dome of St. Peter's, where gleamed
      the Cross of Christ, and rejoiced that "He had triumphed at last." "If
      only Mr. Foote had been there!" Mr. Henson exclaims. Well, Gibbon was
      there before Mr. Henson and before Byron. What he thought in the Colosseum
      I know not, but I know that the great project of <i>The Decline and Fall
      of the Roman Empire</i> took shape in his mind one eventful evening as he
      "sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars
      were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter." Yet I suppose Gibbon's
      fifteenth chapter is scarcely to Mr. Henson's taste. Had I "been there"
      with Mr. Henson, I too might have had my reflections, and I might have
      thrown this Freethought <i>douche</i> on his Christian ardor. "Yes, the
      Cross <i>has</i> triumphed. There it gleams over the dome of St. Peter's,
      the mightiest church in the world. Below it, until the recent subversion
      of the Pope's temporal power, walked the most ignorant, beggarly and
      criminal population in Europe. What are these to the men who built up the
      glory of ancient Rome? What is their city to the magnificent city of old,
      among whose ruins they walk like pigmies amid the relics of giants? This
      time-eaten, weather-beaten Colosseum saw many a gladiator 'butchered to
      make a Roman holiday.' But has not Christian Rome witnessed many a viler
      spectacle? Has it not seen hundreds of noble men burnt alive in the name
      of Christ? When Rome was Pagan, thought was free. Gladiatorial shows
      satisfied the bestial craving in vulgar breasts, but the philosophers and
      poets were unfettered, and the intellect of the few was gradually
      achieving the redemption of the many. When Rome was Christian, she
      introduced a new slavery. Thought was scourged and chained, while the
      cruel instincts of the multitude were gratified with exhibitions of
      suffering, compared with which the bloodiest arena was tame and insipid.
      Your Christian Rome, in the superb metaphor of Hobbes, was but the ghost
      of Pagan Rome, sitting throned and crowned on the grave thereof; nay, a
      ghoul, feeding not on the dead limbs of men, but on their living hearts
      and brains. Look at your Cross! Before Christ appeared it was the symbol
      of life; since it has been the symbol of misery and humiliation; and in
      the name of your Crucified One the people have been crucified between the
      spiritual and temporal thieves. But happily your Cross has had its day.
      St. Peter's may yet crumble before the Colosseum, and the statue of a
      Bruno may outlast the walls of the Vatican."

    <h2>
      CHRIST UP TO DATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an age of weak conviction and strong pretence. Christianity is
      perishing of intellectual atrophy. Its scriptures and its dogmas are
      falling into more and more discredit. Mr. Gladstone may defend the Bible
      with passionate devotion and lofty ignorance, but better informed
      Christians see that the Old Testament is doomed. They say it must be read
      in a new light. Its science and history must be regarded as merely human;
      nay, its very morality savors of the barbarism of the Jews. Only its best
      ethical teaching, and its upward aspirations, are to be regarded as the
      workings or God in the Jewish mind. Nor is this all. There is a revolt
      against the supernaturalism of the New Testament. Christians like Dr.
      Abbott explain away the Resurrection as no physical fact, but a spiritual
      conception. The creed of Christendom is gradually melting away like a
      northern iceberg floating into southern seas. Pinnacle after pinnacle of
      glittering dogma, loosens, falls, and sinks for ever. Only the central
      block remains intact, and we are assured it will never change. The storms
      of controversy will never rend it; the rays of the sun of science will
      never make an impression on its marble firmness. But Freethinkers smile at
      this cheap boast. They know the thaw will continue until the last fragment
      has melted into the infinite ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central, indissoluble part of Christianity is Jesus Christ. He will
      never fade, we are told. He is not for an age, but for all time. When all
      the dogmas of the Churches have perished, the divine figure of Christ will
      survive, and flourish in immortal beauty. All the world will yet worship
      him. "Christ" will be the universal passport in the depths of China, in
      the wilds of Africa, on the Tartar steppes, and among the haunted ruins of
      old Asia, as well as in the present Christendom of Europe and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prophecy is very pretty, but it lacks precision. The prophets forget
      to tell us whether the divine figure of Christ is to be human or
      supernatural; the grandest of men or the smallest of gods. If he be indeed
      a god, they are playing strange tricks with his works and sayings; while,
      if he be indeed a mere man, they forget to explain how it is likely that
      the human race will ever look back to a single dead Jew as the moral
      microcosm, the consummate spiritual flower of humanity, the beacon of
      ideal life to every generation of voyagers on the sea of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logic, however, must not be expected of Christians, at least in an age of
      dissolving views like the present. They will go on quoting Kenan's
      prize-essay panegyric on Christ, without any reference to the rest of his
      Vie de Jesus<i>. They will persist in quoting Mill's farfetched eulogy,
      without referring to other passages in the essay </i>On Liberty. But this
      is not all, nor even the worst. The sentimentalism of "popular" and
      "advanced" Christianity is turning Jesus Christ into a hero of romance. He
      is taking the place of King Arthur, of blameless memory; and we shall soon
      see the Apostles take the place of the Knights of the Round Table. Rancid
      orators and flatulent poets are gathering to the festival Jesus Christ
      will make a fine speech for the one set, and fine copy for the other. The
      professional biographers will cut in for a share in the spoil, and the
      brains of impudence will be ransacked to eke out the stories of Matthew,
      Mark, Luke, and John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lives of Christ are becoming quite fashionable. Fleetwood's honest but
      prosaic book had fallen into-neglect. The very maulers of old bookstalls
      thrust out their tongues at at. The still older book of Jeremy Taylor&mdash;a
      work of real genius and golden eloquence&mdash;was too stiff reading for
      an idle generation. Just in the nick of time the English translation of
      Kenan appeared. The first edition was less scientific than the thirteenth.
      Kenan had only just broken away from the Catholic Church; he was also
      under the influence of his visit to Palestine; his <i>Vie de Jesus</i> was
      therefore a sentimental Parisian romance; the smell of patchouli was on
      every page. Yet here and there the quick reader caught the laugh of
      Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenan's book set a new vogue. The severe, critical Strauss was laid aside
      in England, and "the Savior's" life was "cultivated on new principles." By
      and bye the writers and publishers found there was "money in it." Jesus
      Christ could be made to pay. Dr. Farrar made thousands out of his trashy
      volumes, and his publishers netted a fortune. Mr. Haweis has done the same
      trick with four volumes. Ward Beecher spent his last days on a Life of
      Christ. Talmage is occupied on the same labor of love&mdash;and profit.
      Even the Catholic Church is not behindhand. Pere Didon has put forth <i>his</i>
      Life of Christ in two fat volumes as an antidote to the poison of Kenan.
      And the end is not yet. Nevertheless we see the beginning of the end. It
      was bound to come. After the prose writers prance the versifiers, and Sir
      Edward Arnold is first in the motley procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward Arnold's <i>Light of Asia</i> was a fairly good piece of work.
      He had caught the trick of Tennysonian blank-verse, and he put some of the
      best features of Buddhism before the English public in a manner that
      commanded attention. Standing aloof from Buddhism himself, though
      sympathising with it, he was able to keep an impartial attitude. Further,
      he stuck to the Buddhist stories as he found them. All the license he took
      was that of selection and versification. But his recent <i>Light of the
      World</i> is another matter. He dishes up Jesus Christ in it, and Pontius
      Pilate and Mary Magdalene and the Wise Men of the East, as freely as
      Tennyson dishes up Arthur and Launcelot and Guinevere and the rest of that
      famous company. His style, too, is Tennysonian, to a certain degree. It is
      something like the Master's on its general level, but we miss the flashing
      felicities, the exquisite sentence or image that makes us breathless with
      sudden pleasure. Sir Edward's style has always a smack of the <i>Daily
      Telegraph</i>. He is high-flown in expressing even small ideas, or in
      describing trivialities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a true Christian and courtier, Sir Edwin Arnold dedicates his book to
      "the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty." Those who fear God must also honor
      the king; and did not Jesus himself tell us to render unto Caesar the
      things that be Caesar's, as well as unto God the things that be God's? We
      presume Sir Edwin's dedication is "with permission." We also presume it
      will help the sale and promote his chance of the poet-laureateship.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dedication comes the "Proeme" of eight couplets, occupying a
      separate page, faced and backed with virgin paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sovereign voice spake, once more, in mine ear: "Write, now, a song
      unstained by any tear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I write?" I said: the voice replied: "Write what we tell thee
      of the crucified!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How shall I write," I said, "who am not meet One word of that sweet
      speaking to repeat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be given unto thee! Do this thing!" Answered the voice: "Wash
      thy lips clean, and sing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This "proeme" is, to say the least of it, peculiar. The "sovereign voice"
      can hardly be the Queen's. It must be God Almighty's. Sir Edwin Arnold is
      therefore inspired. He writes as it is "given unto" him. And before he
      begins, by divine direction, he washes his lips clean; though he omits to
      tell us how he did it, whether with a flannel or a pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well to know that Sir Edwin is inspired. Carnal criticism is thus
      disarmed and questions become blasphemous. But if Sir Edwin had <i>not</i>
      been inspired we should have offered certain remarks and put certain
      queries. For instance, how does he know that the star of the Nativity was
      "a strange white star"? May it not have been red, yellow, blue, or green&mdash;especially
      green? How did he discover that the Magi, or priests of the Zoroastrian
      religion, were really Buddhists and came from India? Had Sir Edwin less
      communication with the "sovereign voice," we should have imagined that the
      Magi were transformed into Buddhists for the sake of convenience; Sir
      Edwin knowing comparatively little of the Persic faith, but a good deal of
      the Indian, and possessing a natural itch to display his own learning.
      Further we should have asked him how he discovered that by three years
      after the Crucifixion the Christian faith had spread to Athens and Rome.
      According to all previous records the statement is simply preposterous.
      But the "sovereign voice" has spoken through Sir Edwin Arnold, and thrown
      quite a fresh light on the earliest history of Christianity. Then, again,
      we should have been curious to know why Sir Edwin accepted the legend of
      Mary Magdalene being the tenant of Magdal Tower, a place that never
      existed (as we thought) but in the geography of faith. Humanly speaking,
      it seemed probable that the lady's name had relation to head-dressing. But
      we live and learn, and in the course of time the "sovereign voice" settles
      all these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no clear record in the gospels of Jesus Christ's visit to Tyre,
      but Sir Edwin assures us he spent a few hours there&mdash;perhaps on an
      excursion&mdash;and we bow to the "sovereign voice." Nor is there a
      scholar in Christendom who regards the pretended letter from Publius
      Lentulus to the Roman Senate as anything but a puerile forgery. Yet Sir
      Edwin mentions it in a footnote, apparently with respect; indeed, he
      founds upon it his personal description of Jesus. Once again, scholarship
      must bow to the "sovereign voice." By the way, however, the Lentulus
      epistle describes the hair of Jesus as "wine-color." This is adopted by
      Sir Edwin, who construes is as "hazel," though&mdash;barring inspiration
      and the "sovereign voice"&mdash;it might have meant the color which is
      sometimes politely, if not accurately, called auburn. Anyhow, the ancients
      were acquainted with various colored wines, and it is satisfactory to know
      the precise hue intended by the gentleman who wrote the epistle of
      Lentulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edwin represents Jesus as a Nazarite. Now, the Nazarites eschewed
      scissors and razors, but Sir Edwin says they parted their hair in the
      middle, which is another tip from the "sovereign voice." Sir Edwin flashes
      his inspiration on another point. Critics are satisfied that the Emperor
      Julian, the last of the Pagans, did <i>not</i> cry, <i>Vicisti Galilae</i>!
      Mr. Swinburne, however, as a merely carnal poet, employed the legend in
      his splendid "Proserpina," using it with superb effect in the young
      Pagan's retort, "Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean!&mdash;thy dead
      shall go down to thee dead." But now the "sovereign voice" speaks through
      Sir Edwin Arnold, and the legend must stand as history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the guidance of the "sovereign voice" Sir Edwin is able to enlighten
      us on the physiology of angels. These creatures are usually painted with
      wings. But this is a mistake. They are wingless; for where these live
      there blows no wind, Nor aught spreads, gross as air, nor any kind Of
      substance, whereby spirits' march is stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edwin knows all about them. Angels do not need wings, and have none,
      moving apparently <i>in vacuo</i>. But what havoc this truth would make in
      the picture galleries of Europe. Raphael himself was mistaken. He took
      angels to be a species of fowl, whereas they are&mdash;well, Sir Edwin
      does not tell us. He tells us what they are <i>not</i>. What they are is,
      as usual, left to the fancy of the reader, who pays his money and takes
      his choice. Only he must beware of <i>wings</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Positively the most gratifying thing in Sir Edwin's book is this. Under
      the influence of the "sovereign voice" he is able to tell us how God
      Almighty likes to be designated. Perhaps it is better not to name him at
      all, but if we <i>must</i> name him&mdash;and it seems hard to refrain
      from some term or other&mdash;we should call him <i>Eloi</i>. That is what
      Jesus called him, and we see no reason why it should not become
      fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edwin Arnold's method of dishing up Jesus Christ is certainly artful.
      It does credit to his <i>Daily Telegraph</i> training. Everybody knows
      that one of the chief difficulties of novelists is to make their wonderful
      heroes act and talk. Sir Edwin does not jump this difficulty. He shirks
      it. He takes up the story of Jesus after his death, resurrection, and
      ascension. Three years are allowed to elapse, to give the risen Nazarene
      time to get clean away, and then Sir Edwin begins business. After a
      preliminary section, in, which the three Magi are brought upon the scene,
      the body of the poem opens with Mary Magdalene, who does nearly all the
      talking to the very end. Indeed the poem should have been called after
      her, for it is really "Mary Magdalene on Jesus Christ." The lady gives her
      reminiscences&mdash;that is, Sir Edwin gives them for her. By this method
      he is able to omit all mention of the cruder features of the Gospel story.
      When Jesus played the devil with the pigs, for instance, Mary Magdalene
      was absent, and the incident forms no part of her narrative. Apparently,
      too, she was absent, or deaf, or thinking of something else, when he
      preached hell-fire and "believe or be damned." And as this pretty method
      of Mary-Arnold selection is pursued throughout, it will easily be seen
      that the poem is an arbitrary piece of highly-colored fiction, in which
      Jesus Christ is made to serve the author's purposes. In short it is
      "Christ Up to Date."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edwin's second piece of strategy is still more transparent. Mary
      Magdalene is represented as several ladies rolled into one, and her house
      is a perfect museum of relics. She is Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany, the
      woman who anointed Christ's feet, and the Mary who helped to embalm him.
      She keeps the famous alabaster box in her cabinet; she boards and lodges
      the young woman that Jesus raised from the dead; and her brother Lazarus
      is also on show when required. Lazarus, too, is many single gentlemen
      rolled into one. He is the resurrected man, the young man who was told to
      sell his property and give the proceeds to the poor, and the young man who
      fled stark naked at the arrest of Jesus, leaving his clothes in the hands
      of his pursuers. This is a very convenient plan. It is history made easy,
      or the art of poetical bam-boozling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Magdalene has a long talk with Pontius Pilate, who is haunted by the
      memory of the pale Galilean. Afterwards she has several days' talk with an
      old Indian, who turns out to be the sole survivor of those three wise men
      from the East, come to find out all about the King of the Jews. His two
      colleagues had died without satisfying their curiosity. He himself did
      without news for thirty-six years, and only went back to Palestine after
      the King of the Jews had ended his career; the visit, of course, being
      timed to suit Sir Edwin Arnold's convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the poem Mary Magdalene talks. Arnoldese. Here is a typical
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be there shall come in after days&mdash;When this Good Spell is
      spread&mdash;some later scribes, Some far-off Pharisees, will take His
      law,&mdash;Written with Love's light fingers on the heart, Not stamped on
      stone 'mid glare of lightning-fork&mdash;Will take, and make its code
      incorporate; And from its grace write grim phylacteries To deck the head
      of dressed Authority; And from its golden mysteries forge keys To jingle
      in the belt of pious pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      Can anyone imagine the seven-devilled Mary Magdalene conversing in this
      way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Considered in the light of its title this poem is a mistake and a
      monstrous failure. It is also labored and full of "fine writing." Not only
      are the Gospel story and the teachings of Jesus played fast and loose
      with, but the simplest things are narrated in grandiose language, with a
      perfect glut of fanciful imagery, fetched in not to illustrate but to
      adorn. Here and there, however, the language of Jesus is paraphrased and
      damnably spoiled. What reader of the Gospes does not remember the
      exquisite English in which our translators have rendered the lament over
      Jerusalem? Sir Edwin parodies it as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      How oft I would have gathered all thy children in As a hen clucks her
      chickens to her wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely this is perfectly ridiculous. The collecting and sheltering are put
      into the background by that dreadful "cluck," and the reader is forced to
      imagine Jesus as a clucking hen. On the whole, the Gospel writers were
      better artists than Sir Edwin Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      To conclude. The poem contains plenty of "fine writing" and some good
      lines. But as a whole it is "neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red
      herring." As a picture of Jesus Christ it is a laborious absurdity; as a
      marketable volume it may be successful; and as a sample of Sir Edwin
      Arnold's powers and accomplishments it will perhaps impose on
      half-educated sentimentalists.

      SECULARISM AND CHRISTIANITY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A Letter to the "<i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>," January 8, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;A friend has favored me with a copy of your last issue,
      containing a long report of the Rev. W. E. Blomfield's sermon at Turret
      Green Chapel, apparently in reply to my lecture on "Secularism superior to
      Christianity." Mr. Blomfield declines to meet me in set debate, on the
      ground that I am not "a <i>reverent</i> Freethinker," which is indeed
      true; but I observe that he does not really mind arguing with me, only he
      prefers to do it where I cannot answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield finds the pulpit a safe place for what can hardly be called
      the courtesies of discussion. He refers to certain remarks of mine (I
      presume) as "petty jokes and witticisms fit only for the tap-room of a
      fourth-rate tavern." I will not dispute the description. I defer to Mr.
      Blomfield's superior knowledge of taverns and tap-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I notice Mr. Blomfield's great parade of "reverence." I notice also that
      he speaks of Freethought arguments or objections as "short-sighted folly"
      and "sheer nonsense." I judge, therefore, that "reverence" is not intended
      by Mr. Blomfield to be reciprocal. He claims a monopoly of it for his own
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he would only take the trouble to think about the matter, it might
      occur to him that "reverence" is not, properly speaking, a preliminary but
      a result. Let us have inquiry and discussion first and "reverence"
      afterwards. If I find anything to revere I shall not need Mr. Blomfield's
      admonitions. I revere truth, goodness, and heroism, though I cannot revere
      what I regard as false or absurd. "Reverence" is often the demand that
      imposture makes on honesty and superstition on intelligence. Long faces
      are highly valued by the professors of mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield did not hear my lecture. Had he done so he would have found
      an answer to many of his questions. It is all very well to bid the Ipswich
      people to "Beware of false prophets," but it is better to hear before
      condemning.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much attention, Mr. Blomfield asks, am I to give to this world and how
      much to another? Just as much as they deserve. We know a great deal about
      this world, and may learn more. There are plenty of guesses about another
      world, but no knowledge. It is easy to ask "Is there a future life?" but
      we must die to find out. Meanwhile this life confronts us, with its hard
      duties and legitimate pleasures. It is our wisdom to make the best of it,
      on the rational belief that, if there should be a future life&mdash;which
      no one is in a position to affirm or deny&mdash;this must be the best
      preparation for it, whether our future be decided by evolution or divine
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield's arguments against Utility as the test of conduct were
      answered in my lecture. He says the principle is of difficult application.
      So are all principles in intricate cases; why else have Christian divines
      written so many tons of casuistry? In any case the Utilitarian principle
      is the only one which is honored in practice. Other principles do very
      well on Sunday, but they are cast aside on Monday. The only question asked
      by statesmen, county councillors, School Board members, or other public
      representatives, is "Will the proposal tend to benefit the people?" This
      can be debated and settled. "Is it according to the will of God?" is a
      question to set people by the ears and raise an endless quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield says the fear of God saved poor Joseph, yet I dare say
      Potiphar's wife was a religious woman. The will of God sanctions many
      crimes. It tells the Thug to kill travellers; it told the Inquisition to
      torture and burn heretics; it told the Catholics and Protestants to rack
      and slaughter witches; it told Christians and Mohammedans to fight each
      other on hundreds of bloody battle-fields; it tells Christians now to keep
      up laws against liberty of thought. There never was a time when these
      things would not have been denounced by Secularism as crimes against
      humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motives to morality do not come from religion. They come from our social
      sympathies. Preach to a tiger and he will eat you. Differ from a
      Torquemada and he will burn you. When one man wants another to help him,
      he does not judge by the name of his sect, but by the glance of his eye
      and the lines of his mouth. Some men are born philanthropists, others are
      born criminals; between these are multitudes in whom good and bad
      tendencies are variously mixed, and who may be made better or worse by
      education and environment. The late Professor Clifford was an Atheist, and
      one of the gentlest, kindest, and tenderest men that ever lived. Jay Gould
      was a member of a Christian church and sometimes went round with the
      plate. He left twenty millions of money, and not a penny to any charity or
      good cause. Lick, the Freethinker, built and endowed the great observatory
      which is one of the glories of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not propose to follow Mr. Blomfield in his excursion into ancient
      history. I will only remark that if he thinks there was any lack of
      "religion" in the worst days of the Pagan world he is very much mistaken.
      Coming to more modern times, I decline to accept his present of priests
      and popes who were "atheistic." Whatever they were is a domestic question
      for the Christian Church. Nor need I discuss Luther's "fresh vision of
      God." He was a great man, but a savage controversialist, who called his
      opponents asses, swine, foxes, geese, and fools; which, I suppose, is
      worthy of the tap-room of a <i>first-rate</i> tavern. As to the "awful
      collapse" of "unbelieving France" I do not know when it occurred. It was
      certainly not France that collapsed in the Revolution. The monarchy, the
      aristocracy, and the Church collapsed; but France inaugurated a new epoch
      of modern history.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to prayer, on which Mr. Blomfield is very hazy, I would like
      to discriminate between its "objective value" and its "subjective
      benefits." Prayer as a means of inducing patience when you do not get what
      you ask for, is outside my province. I leave it to the clergy. Prayer as a
      means of obtaining what you require is my concern, and I defy Mr.
      Blomfield to prove a single case. Yet if prayer is not answered
      objectively, the Secular principle holds the field that science is man's
      only providence. I am aware that Christians employ doctors, insure their
      houses, and put lightning-conductors over their church steeples. They
      leave as little to God as possible. Mr. Blomfield says this is quite
      right, and I agree with him; but I will give him, if he cannot find them,
      twenty texts in support of the honest old doctrine of prayer from the New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield tells me I do not understand the Bible. Well, as I am not
      exactly a fool, the fault may be in the book. Why was it not made plainer?
      Why did God write it so that thousands of gentlemen get a fine living by
      explaining it&mdash;in all sorts of different ways? I am reminded that the
      Bible is not a handbook of physical science. But did the Church think so
      when it imprisoned Galileo and made him swear that the earth did <i>not</i>
      go round the sun? Mr. Blomfield says that "Genesis gives an account of the
      origin of matter, and of life, and, finally, of man, which science has not
      disproved, on the admission of her most eminent sons." The Bible is a
      handbook of science after all then! But what has science to do with the
      origin of matter? The origin of life is still an open question. The origin
      of man is <i>not</i> an open question. Genesis gives us a piece of
      mythology; Darwin gave us the truth. Among the eminent sons of science who
      is greater than he? Yet he has utterly exploded the Adam and Eve story.
      Darwin has left it on record that he rejected all revelation, and that for
      nearly forty years of his life he was a disbeliever in Christianity. He
      did subscribe to a Missionary Society that was attempting to reform South
      American savages, but he never subscribed a penny for the propagation of
      Christianity in England. I myself might think Christianity good for
      savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I understand Mr. Blomfield rightly, God was unable to teach the Jews
      any faster than he did, although he is both omnipotent and omniscient.
      Were I to imitate Mr. Blomfield I should call this "sheer nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      In my lecture I stated that the Old Testament sanctioned slavery, and that
      there was not a word against it in the New Testament. Mr. Blomfield
      replies that "the principles of the New Testament sapped the foundations
      of that system." But let us deal with one question at a time. Let the
      reverend gentleman indicate the text which I say does not exist. As for
      the "generous spirit" of the Old Testament laws about slavery, am I to
      find it in the texts allowing the Jews to buy and sell the heathen, to
      enslave their own countrymen, to appropriate their children born in
      slavery, and to beat them to death providing they did not expire within
      forty-eight hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      My point is not that the Jews held slaves. That was common in ancient
      times. I merely take objection to the doctrine that God laid down the
      slavery laws of the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to Jesus Christ, I am not aware that I have spoken of him as a
      "trickster." Kenan, however, whom Mr. Blomfield appears to admire,
      suggests that the raising of Lazarus was a performance arranged between
      him and Jesus. This is a line of criticism I have never attempted. I do
      not regard the New Testament miracles as actual occurrences, but as the
      products of Christian imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield is angry with me for saying that the books of the Bible are
      mostly anonymous, yet he declares that "their anonymity is little against
      them." I leave Mr. Blomfield to settle the point of fact with Christian
      writers like Canon Driver and Professor Bruce. With respect to the New
      Testament, I am told that my statement is "palpably incorrect." But what
      are the facts? With the exception of four of Paul's epistles, and perhaps
      the first of Peter, the whole of the New Testament books are anonymous, in
      the sense that they were not written&mdash;as we have them&mdash;by the
      men whose names they bear, and that no one knows who <i>did</i> write
      them. This is practically admitted by Christian scholars, and I am ready
      to maintain it in discussion with Mr. Blomfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield talks very freely, in conclusion, about the "fruits" of
      Christianity and Secularism. He even condescends to personal comparisons,
      which I warn him are dangerous. He compares Spurgeon with Bradlaugh. Well,
      the one swam with the stream, and the other against it; the one lived in
      the world's smile, the other in the world's frown; the one enjoyed every
      comfort and many luxuries, the other was poor, worried, and harassed into
      his grave. Spurgeon was no doubt a good man, but Bradlaugh was the more
      heroic figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus Christ said some good things. Among them was the injunction not to
      let one hand know the other's charity. Mr. Blomfield disregards this. He
      challenges Secularists to a comparison. He asks where are our Secularist
      hospitals. We do not believe in such things. Sectarianism in charity is a
      Christian vice. On the other hand, our party is comparatively small and
      poor, and Christian laws prevent our holding any trusts for Secularism.
      Still, we do attend to our own poor as well as we can. Our Benevolent Fund
      is sufficient for the relief of those who apply in distress. We cannot
      build "almshouses," but "Atheist widows" are not neglected. On the whole,
      however, we are not so loud as the Christians in praise of "charity," Much
      of it is very degrading. If we had justice in society there would be less
      for "charity" to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious that Mr. Blomfield picks his fruits of Christianity with
      great discrimination. Is it logical to select all you admire in Christian
      countries and attribute it to Christianity? The same process would prove
      the excellence of Buddhism, Brahminism, and Mohammedanism. There are
      almshouses and hospitals in Chrisendom, but there are also workhouses,
      gin-palaces, brothels, and prisons. Drunkenness, prostitution, and
      gambling, are the special vices of Christian nations. It is Christian
      countries that build ironclads and make cannon, gatling guns, deadly
      rifles, and terrible explosives. It is Christians who do most of the
      fighting on this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blomfield may or may not consider these things. I scarcely expect him
      to reply. He prefers the "humble, obedient heart" to the "curious
      intellect." At any rate he preaches the preference to the young men of
      Ipswich. For my part, I hope they will reject the counsel. I trust they
      will read, inquire, and think for themselves. Their "intellect" should
      have enough "curiosity" to be satisfied as to the truth of what they are
      asked to believe.

      ALTAR AND THRONE. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * June 11, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      Myriads of honest, industrious women in England are laboring excessively
      for a bare pittance; day after day they go through the same monotonous and
      exhausting round of toil; and the end of it all is a bit of bread for some
      who are dear to them, and a squalid, cheerless existence for themselves.
      Sometimes, when work is scarce, and sheer starvation confronts them, they
      are driven to the last resource of selling their bodies, and enter the
      unspeakable inferno of prostitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      England has thousands of other women who are lapped in an enervating and
      degrading luxury&mdash;without occupation, with none but frivolous cares&mdash;who
      fancy themselves infinitely superior to their poor, slaving, ill-dressed,
      and toilworn sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      These disparities are as great as any that existed in the "infamous" days
      of pagan Rome. The world has had eighteen hundred years of Christianity,
      and its "salvation" is still in the dim and distant future.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the clergy have preached a hell after death, the people have been
      left simmering in a real hell in this life&mdash;the hell of ignorance,
      poverty, oppression, and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity is now boasting of what it is <i>going</i> to do. It says it
      begins to understand Jesus Christ; it means to follows in its Master's
      footsteps; it will strain every nerve to raise the downtrodden, to better
      the condition of the poor, and to give true comfort to the afflicted.
      There are some individual Christians who mean this and try to practise it.
      But for the most part these fine new promises of Christianity are nothing
      but sermon decorations, words for deeds, sawdust for bread, flash notes
      for good coin of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have but to look around us at this moment to see the true fruits of
      Christianity. It is the same fruit that <i>all</i> religion bears. Under
      the pretence of being the best friend of the people, Christianity (like
      other religions) has been the real friend of the privileged classes. It
      has also fostered a public sentiment in this direction. To prove this let
      us take a case in point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time ago an English princess lost her lover by death. She was said to
      be inconsolable. But before long it was whispered that she was to marry
      her lover's brother. At length it was announced in the papers, only to be
      contradicted as a false rumor which very much hurt the feelings of all the
      parties it concerned. Those who understood the nature of such
      contradictions smiled. By and bye the contradicted rumor was announced
      authoritatively. Princess May <i>was</i> to marry the gentleman in
      question. "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by
      this sun of York."
    </p>
    <p>
      All England was soon astir with loyal enthusiasm, and people were
      everywhere set subscribing for presents to the dear Princess. Soldiers and
      sailors are sweated. Pressure is put upon theatrical people. "You <i>must</i>
      give <i>something</i>," is the cry. The City of London is to spend £2,500
      on a necklace. One lady gives the royal couple a splendid country house
      with magnificent grounds. Committees are formed right and left, and tens
      of thousands of pounds will be raised, on the ground that "unto him that
      hath shall be given"&mdash;in some cases, also, without neglecting the
      rest of the text, that "from him that hath not shall be taken away even
      that which he hath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Who is the Princess May? Very likely a pleasant young lady. Happily there
      are myriads of them in England. What has she ever done? She took the
      trouble to be born. Her husband that is to be has an income from "the
      service." His father has £36,000 a year, voted by Parliament, for the
      express purpose of providing for his children&mdash;in addition to his big
      income from other sources. All things considered, it does not seem that
      Princess May and the Duke of York are in want of anything. But how many
      other women&mdash;to say nothing of men&mdash;<i>are</i> in want! Is not
      this lavish generosity to a pair of royal and well-provided lovers an
      insult to the working people of England? Is it not a special insult to the
      multitude of poor, struggling women, whose earnings are taxed to support
      the classes who lord it over them? It may, of course, be replied that poor
      women like the idea of all these presents to the Princess. Perhaps they
      do. But that only makes it worse. It shows their training has corrupted
      them. The last vice of a slave is to admire his oppressor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity is satisfied with this state of things. Christian ministers
      will wink at it, when they do not bless it and approve it with a text. The
      Archbishop of Canterbury will officiate at the royal wedding, and deliver
      one of those courtier-like homilies which may be expected from one who
      takes £15,000 a year to preach the blessings of poverty and the damnable
      nature of wealth. This is what comes of eighteen hundred years of the
      "poor Carpenter's" religion. His texts of renunciation are idle verbiage.
      His name is used to bamboozle the people, to despoil them, and to make
      them patient asses under their burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion and privilege go together. What does the New Testament say? "Fear
      God and honor the king." Fearing God means supporting the clergy. Honoring
      the king means keeping one family in foolish luxury, as a symbol of the
      whole system of privilege which is maintained by the systematic
      exploitation of the people. We are crucified between two thieves who mock
      us, but do not share our cross; the spiritual thief, who robs us of our
      birthright of mental freedom, and the temporal thief, who robs us of the
      fruit of our labor. <i>Arcades ambo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people will think we have written too plainly. We beg to tell them
      that we have had to practise self-restraint. The fat would be in the fire
      with a vengeance if we gave free expression to our disgust. The only hope
      for the future of society lies in the absolute extermination of
      Christianity. That is the superstition which fools and degrades Europe,
      and we must fight it to the death.

    <h2>
      MARTIN LUTHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reformation Day, as it is called, was celebrated on October 31 throughout
      the Protestant part of Germany. Three hundred and seventy-five years have
      rolled by since Martin Luther broke from the Roman Catholic Church.
      Emperor William went to Wittenberg, with a great array of Evangelical
      personages; and, as usual, the Emperor made a speech, which for him was
      excellent. "There is no coercion," he said, "in matters of religion. Here
      only free conviction of the heart is decisive, and the perception of this
      fact is the blissful fruit of the Reformation."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a fine-sounding declaration, but it has the misfortune to be
      untrue. Liberty of conscience is not the fruit of the Reformation, but an
      indirect and unintended result. Nor is liberty of conscience a reality in
      any part of the German empire. Christians are allowed to differ among
      themselves, but Freethinkers are prosecuted for dissenting alike from
      Catholic and Protestant. Since the present Emperor's accession there have
      been many blasphemy prosecutions, sometimes for what would be regarded in
      other countries as very mild expressions of disbelief. Several men and
      women have been sentenced to severe penalties for exercising the right of
      free speech, which, in the land of Goethe, Heine, Strauss, and
      Schopenhauer, is still confined to professed Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reformation, in fact, was a superficial movement. Except for its moral
      revolt against the sale of indulgences, it touched no deep and durable
      principle. It merely substituted an infallible Bible for an infallible
      Church. Differences of opinion crept into the Protestant fold, but that
      was an accident, arising from the varied and discordant nature of the
      Bible itself. Every new Protestant sect had to fight as strenuously for
      its right to exist as ever Martin Luther fought against the Catholic
      Church. Protestantism, in short, was one priesthood saying to another
      priesthood "We are right and you are wrong." The Catholic Church had an
      immense advantage in its central organisation; the Protestant Church could
      only operate from different points; hence it was unable to bring about the
      same uniformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement that was not superficial was the scientific and humanist
      movement, of which the Reformation was in a certain sense an episode.
      Italy and France did more for the world than Germany. Martin Luther was a
      great fighter, but not a more heroic one than Giordano Bruno. Melancthon
      was not so important a man as Galileo. Rabelais even, with all his dirt
      and jesting, was more in the stream of progress than Luther, and far more
      than Calvin. In the long run, it is knowledge and idea? that rule the
      world. Luther was not great in knowledge, and certainly not great in
      ideas. He was a born fighter and a strong character. His proper place is
      among the heroic figures of history. He was a man of leading, but scarcely
      a man of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luther was violently opposed to the scientific movement. He called
      Copernicus an old fool. He would hear nothing against the accepted
      Biblical theory of the universe. Genesis was to him, as well as to the
      Pope, the beginning and the end of sound science. Nor was he more friendly
      to philosophy. Draper truly asserts that the leaders of the Reformation
      "were determined to banish philosophy from the Church." Aristotle was
      villified by Luther as "truly a devil, a horrid calumniator, a wicked
      sycophant, a prince of darkness, a real Apollyon, a beast, a most horrid
      impostor on mankind, a public and professed liar, a goat, a complete
      epicure, this twice execrable Aristotle." Such was Luther's style in
      controversy. We commend it to the attention of Protestants who rail at the
      <i>Freethinker</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberty of conscience is a principle of which Luther had no conception. He
      claimed the right to think against the Pope; he denied the right of others
      to think against himself. His attitude towards the Anabaptists was
      fiendish. During the Peasants War he urged the authorities to exterminate
      the rebels, to "stab, kill, and strangle them without mercy." Melancthon
      taught that heretics "ought to be restrained by the sword." Luther
      likewise declared that whoever denied even one article of the Protestant
      faith should be punished severely. Referring to a false teacher, he
      exclaimed, "Drive him away as an apostle of hell; and if he does not flee,
      deliver him up as a seditious man to the executioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallam, Buckle, Lecky, and all reputable historians, agree that the
      Protestant party held the same principle of persecution as the Catholics.
      It was not disputed that death was the proper punishment of obstinate
      heresy. The only dispute was&mdash;which were the heretics, and who should
      die?
    </p>
    <p>
      Luther's influence was very great in England, as Calvin's was in Scotland,
      and the leaders of the Reformation in our own country had no doubt as to
      the justice of killing men for a difference of opinion. Cranmer taught
      that heretics were first to be excommunicated; if that made no impression
      on them they were to suffer death. It satisfies one sense of the fitness
      of things that Cranmer himself perished at the stake. Becon taught that
      the duty of magistrates with regard to heretics was to punish them&mdash;"yea,
      and also to take them out of this life." This same Becon called upon the
      temporal rulers to "be no longer the pope's hangmen." He preferred their
      being the hangmen of Protestantism. Latimer himself said of the
      Anabaptists who were executed, "Well, let them go!" Bishop Jewel, the
      great apologist of the Protestant Church of England, in answering Harding
      the Jesuit, replies in this way to the charge of being of the brotherhood
      of Servetus, David George, and Joan of Kent: "We detected their heresies,
      and not you. We arraigned them; we condemned them. We put them to the
      execution of the laws. It seemeth very much to call them our brothers,
      because we burnt them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin held the same persecuting doctrine. All who opposed him were dealt
      with ruthlessly. He was a veritable Pope of Geneva. His treatment of
      Servetus was infamous. But so universal was the principle on which Calvin
      acted, that even the mild Melancthon called the cruel roasting of Servetus
      at a slow fire "a pious and memorable example for all posterity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestantism boasts of having asserted the right of private judgment. It
      never did anything of the kind. Not a single leader of the Reformation
      ever asserted such a principle. Erasmus did, though not in decisive
      language; but Erasmus never belonged to the Protestant Church, and his
      humanity, no less than his philosophy, brought upon him the vituperation
      of Luther. The hero of Protestantism did not intend the consequences of
      his revolt against Rome. He would have been appalled at the thought of
      them. He made a breach, for his own purposes, in the great wall of faith.
      He did not anticipate that others would widen it, or that the forces of
      reason would march through and occupy post after post. He simply did his
      own stroke of work, and we do not judge him by later standards. We only
      object to the extravagance of Protestant laudation.

    <h2>
      THE PRAISE OF FOLLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is the greatest novel in the English language? This is a hard
      question, which we shall not attempt to answer. We leave every one of our
      readers to enjoy his own selection. But the question has been answered, in
      his own way, by a living novelist. Mr. Walter Besant declares that the
      greatest novel in the English language is Charles Reade's <i>The Cloister
      and the Hearth</i>. That it is a <i>great</i> book no one fit to judge
      will deny, or hesitate to affirm. It is full of adventure and hairbreadth
      escapes; it exhibits a large variety of life and character; its wit,
      insight, and pathos show the mind and hand of a master; and a certain
      vivid actuality is derived from the fact that its pictures and portraits
      are to a large extent historical. Gerard and Margaret, the hero and
      heroine of the story, are the father and mother of the great Erasmus;
      respecting whom Charles Reade closes his book with a noble and pregnant
      piece of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First scholar and divine of his epoch, he was also the heaven-born
      dramatist of his century. Some of the best scenes in this new book are
      from his mediaeval pen, and illumine the pages whence they come; for the
      words of a genius, so high as his, are not born to die; their immediate
      work upon mankind fulfilled, they may seem to lie torpid; but, at each
      fresh shower of intelligence Time pours upon their students, they prove
      their immortal race; they revive, they spring from the dust of great
      libraries; they bud, they flower, they fruit, they seed, from generation
      to generation, and from age to age."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus was born at Rotterdam, probably on October 28, 1467. He was a
      "love child." His father, Gerard of Tergou, being engaged to Margaret,
      daughter of a physician of Sevenbergen, anticipated the nuptial rites.
      Gerard's relations drove him from his country by ill usage; when he went
      to Rome, to earn a living by copying ancient authors, they falsely sent
      him word that his Margaret had died; upon which he took holy orders, and
      became a sworn son of the Church. Finding his Margaret alive on his
      return, he of course lived apart from her, and she did not marry another.
      They had a common interest in their boy, whose education they
      superintended. Margaret died of the plague, when Erasmus was thirteen; and
      Gerard, inconsolable for her loss, soon followed her to the grave. Their
      boy was left to the guardianship of relatives, who cheated him of his
      little patrimony, and compelled him to adopt a religious life. Erasmus was
      thus a priest, though a very uncommon one. How curious that so many great
      wits and humorists should have worn the clerical garb! To mention only
      four, there were Rabelais, Erasmus, Swift and Sterne; each of whom has
      added to the world's gaiety, and also helped to free it from superstition.
      Christians who prate about the "ridicule" of holy things in which
      Freethinkers indulge, should be reminded that these four priests of the
      Christian religion could easily, between them, carry off the palm for
      profanity; while for downright plain speech, not always avoiding the
      nastiest of subjects, there is hardly a professed sceptic who could hold a
      candle to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus divorced himself from religious duties as early as possible. He
      detested the monks, regarding them for the most part as illiterate,
      bigoted, persecuting, and parasitical vermin. His life was devoted to
      literature, and in the course of his travels he contracted a friendship
      with the most eminent and able men of the age, including our own Sir
      Thomas More, the author of the famous <i>Utopia</i>. Erasmus died on July
      12,1536. The money he had accumulated by the exercise of his pen, after
      deducting some handsome legacies to personal friends, he left to relieve
      the sick and poor, to marry young women, and to assist young men of good
      character. This was in keeping with his professed principles. He always
      regarded <i>charity</i> as the chief part of <i>useful</i> religion, and
      thought that men should help each other like brothers, instead of fighting
      like wild beasts over theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus was a contemporary of Luther, and there is an excellent Essay by
      Mr. Froude on both these great men. He gives the palm to Luther on account
      of his courage, and thinks that Erasmus should have joined the Reformation
      party. But the truth is that Erasmus had far more <i>intellect</i> than
      Luther; he knew too much to be a fanatic; and while he lashed the vices
      and follies of the Catholic Church, he never left her fold, partly because
      he perceived that Luther and the Reformers were as much the slaves of
      exclusive dogmas as the very Schoolmen themselves. Erasmus believed in
      freedom of thought, but Luther never did. To sum up the difference between
      them in a sentence: Luther was a Theologian, and Erasmus a Humanist. "He
      was brilliantly gifted," says Mr. Froude, "his industry never tired, his
      intellect was true to itself, and no worldly motives ever tempted him into
      insincerity."

      The great mass of the writings of Erasmus are only of interest to
      scholars. His two popular books are the <i>Colloquies</i> and the <i>Praise
      of Folly</i>, both written in Latin, but translated into most of the
      European tongues. The <i>Colloquies</i> were rendered into fine, nervous
      English by N. Bailey, the old lexicographer. The <i>Praise of Folly</i>,
      illustrated with Holbein's drawings, is also to be read in English, in the
      translation of Sir Roger L'Estrange; a writer who, if he was sometimes
      coarse and slangy, had a first-rate command of our language, and was never
      lacking in racy vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus wrote the <i>Praise of Folly</i> in the house of Sir Thomas More,
      with whom he lodged on his arrival in England in 1510. It was completed in
      a week, and written to divert himself and his friend. A copy being sent to
      France, it was printed there, and in a few months it went through seven
      editions. Its contents were such, that it is no wonder, in the words of
      Jortin, that "he was never after this looked upon as a true son of the
      Church." In the orthodox sense of the term, it would be difficult to look
      upon the writer of this book as a true Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folly is made to speak throughout. She pronounces her own panegyric She
      represents herself as the mainspring of all the business and pleasure of
      this world, yes, and also of its worship and devotion. Mixed up with
      capital fooling, there is an abundance of wisdom, and shrewd thrusts are
      delivered at every species of imposture; nay, religion itself is treated
      with derision, under the pretence of buffoonery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before Luther began his campaign against the sale of Pardons and
      Indulgences, they were satirically denounced by Erasmus. He calls them
      "cheats," for the advantage of the clergy, who promise their dupes in
      return for their cash a lot of happiness in the next life; though, as to
      their own share of this happiness, the clergy "care not how long it be
      deferred." Erasmus anticipated Luther in another point. Speaking of the
      subtle interpreters of the Bible in his day, who proved from it anything
      and everything, he says that, "They can deal with any text of scripture as
      with a nose of wax, and knead it into what shape best suits their
      interest." Quite as decisively as Luther, though with less passion and
      scurrility, he condemns the adoration of saints, which he calls a
      "downright folly." Amidst a comical account of the prayers offered up to
      their saintships, he mentions the tokens of gratitude to them hung upon
      the walls and ceilings of churches; and adds, very shrewdly, that he could
      find "no relics presented as a memorandum of any that were ever cured of
      Folly, or had been made one dram the wiser." Even the worship of the
      Virgin Mary is glanced at&mdash;her blind devotees being said "to think it
      manners now to place the mother before the Son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus calls the monks "a sort of brainsick fools," who "seem confident
      of becoming greater proficients in divine mysteries the less they are
      poisoned with any human learning." Monks, as the name denotes, should live
      solitary; but they swarm in streets and alleys, and make a profitable
      trade of beggary, to the detriment of the roadside mendicants. They are
      full of vice and religious punctilios. Some of them will not touch a piece
      of money, but they "make no scruple of the sin of drunkenness and the lust
      of the flesh."
    </p>
    <p>
      Preachers are satirised likewise. They are little else than stage-players.
      "Good Lord! how mimical are their gestures! What heights and falls in
      their voice! What teeming, what bawling, what singing, what squeaking,
      what grimaces, making of mouths, apes' faces, and distorting of their
      countenance; and this art of oratory, as a choice mystery, they convey
      down by tradition to one another." Yes, and the trick of it still lives in
      our Christian pulpits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good old tun-bellied divines," and others of the species, come in for
      their share of raillery. They know that ignorance is the mother of
      devotion. They are great disputants, and all the logic in the world will
      never drive them into a corner from which they cannot escape by some "easy
      distinction." They discuss the absurdest and most far-fetched questions,
      have cats' eyes that see best in the dark, and possess "such a piercing
      faculty as to see through an inch-board, and spy out what really never had
      any being." The apostles would not be able to understand their disputes
      without a special illumination. In a happy phrase, they are said to spend
      their time in striking "the fire of subtlety out of the flint of
      obscurity." But woe to the man who meddles with them; for they are
      generally very hot and passionate. If you differ from them ever so little,
      they call upon you to recant; it you refuse to do so, they will brand you
      as a heretic and "thunder out an excommunication."
    </p>
    <p>
      Popes fare as badly as preachers, monks, and divines. They "pretend
      themselves vicars of Christ." Reference is made to their "grooms, ostlers,
      serving men, pimps, and somewhat else which for modesty's sake I shall not
      mention." They fight with a holy zeal to defend their possessions, and
      issue their bulls and excommunications most frequently against "those who,
      at the instigation of the Devil, and not having the fear of God before
      their eyes, do feloniously and maliciously attempt to lessen and impair
      St. Peter's patrimony."
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking through the mouth of Folly, the biting wit of Erasmus does not
      spare Christianity itself. "Fools," he says, "for their plainness and
      sincerity of heart, have always been most acceptable to God Almighty."
      Princes have ever been jealous of subjects who were too observant and
      thoughtful; and Jesus Christ, in like manner, condemns the wise and
      crafty. He solemnly thanks his Father for hiding the mysteries of
      salvation from the wise, and revealing them to babes; that is, says
      Erasmus, <i>to fools</i>. "Woe unto you scribes and pharisees" means "Woe
      unto you wise men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus seemed "chiefly delighted with women, children, and illiterate
      fishermen." The blessed souls that in the day of judgment are to be placed
      on the Savior's right hand "are called sheep, which are the most senseless
      and stupid of all cattle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor would he heal those breaches our sins had made by any other method
      than by the 'foolishness of the cross,' published by the ignorant and
      unlearned apostles, to whom he frequently recommends the excellence of
      Folly, cautioning them against the infectiousness of wisdom, by the
      several examples he proposes them to imitate, such as children, lilies,
      sparrows, mustard, and such like beings, which are either wholly
      inanimate, or at least devoid of reason and ingenuity, guided by no other
      conduct than that of instinct, without care, trouble, or contrivance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Christian religion," Erasmus says, "seems to have some relations to
      Folly, and no alliance at all to wisdom." In proof of which we are to
      observe; <i>first</i>, that "children, women, old men, and fools, led as
      it were by a secret impulse of nature, are always most constant in
      repairing to church, and most zealous, devout and attentive in the
      performance of the several parts of divine service "; <i>secondly</i>,
      that true Christians invite affronts by an easy forgiveness of injuries,
      suffer themselves like doves to be easily cheated and imposed upon, love
      their enemies as much as their friends, banish pleasure and court sorrow,
      and wish themselves out of this world altogether. Nay, the very happiness
      they look forward to hereafter is "no better than a sort of madness or
      folly." For those who macerate the body, and long to put on immortality,
      are only in a kind of dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They speak many things at an abrupt and incoherent rate, as if they were
      actuated by some possessing demon; they make an inarticulate noise,
      without any distinguishable sense or meaning. They sometimes screw and
      distort their faces to uncouth and antic looks; at one time beyond measure
      cheerful, then as immoderately sullen; now sobbing, then laughing, and
      soon after sighing, as if they were perfectly distracted, and out of their
      senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps the worst stroke of all against Christianity is the following
      sly one. Folly is said to be acceptable, or at least excusable, to the
      gods, who "easily pass by the heedless failures of fools, while the
      miscarriages of such as are known to have more wit shall very hardly
      obtain a pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Did space permit we might give several extracts from the <i>Praise of
      Folly</i>, showing that Erasmus could speed the shafts of his satire at
      the very essentials of religion, such as prayer and providence. Were he
      living now, we may be sure that he would be in the van of the Army of
      Liberation. Living when he did, he performed a high and useful task. His
      keen, bright sword played havoc with much superstition and imposture. He
      made it more difficult for the pious wranglers over what Carlyle would
      call "inconceivable incredibilities" to practise their holy profession.
      Certainly he earned, and more than earned, the praise of Pope.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     At length Erasmus, that great injur'd name
     (The glory of the priesthood and the shame!)
     Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barbarous age,
     And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.
</pre>
    <p>
      Erasmus was, in fact, the precursor of Voltaire. Physically, as well as
      intellectually, these two great men bore a certain resemblance. A glance
      at the strong, shrewd face of Erasmus is enough to show that he was not a
      man to be easily imposed upon; and the square chin, and firm mouth,
      bespeak a determination, which, if it did not run to martyrdom, was
      sufficient to carry its possessor through hardship and difficulty in the
      advocacy of his ideals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome, says, the proverb, was not built in a day; and Christianity was not
      built in a century. It took hundreds of years to complete, as it is taking
      hundreds of years to dissolve. For this reason it is a very complicated
      structure. There is something in it for all sorts of taste. Those who like
      metaphysics will find it in Paul's epistles, and in such dogmas as that of
      the Trinity. Those who like a stern creed will find it in the texts that
      formed the basis of Calvinism. And those who like something milder will
      find it in such texts as "Love one another" and "Father forgive them, they
      know not what they do."
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed, however, that the terrible aspects of Christianity
      have been most in evidence. Religion had its first roots in ignorance and
      terror, and it must continue to derive sustenance from them or perish.
      People were never allured by the simple prospect of heaven; they were
      frightened by the awful prospect of hell. Of course the two things were
      always more or less mixed. The recipe was brimstone and treacle, but the
      brimstone predominated, and was the more operative ingredient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Present-day sermons tell us chiefly of God's goodness; older sermons tell
      us chiefly of what is called his justice. Puritan discourses, of the
      seventeenth century, were largely occupied in telling people that most of
      them <i>would</i> be damned, and explaining to them how just and logical
      it was that they <i>should</i> be damned. It was a sort of treatment they
      should really be thankful for; and, instead of protesting against it, they
      should take it with folded hands and grateful submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many preachers have depicted the torments of the damned! How many have
      described the fate of lost souls! They positively delighted in the task,
      as corrupted organs of smell will sometimes delight in abominable
      stenches. Even the average Christian has regarded damnation&mdash;especially
      the damnation of other people&mdash;with remarkable complacency, as a part
      of the established economy of the universe. But now and then a superior
      spirit revolted against it instinctively. Thus we hear of Gregory the
      Great, in an age when it was devoutly believed that the noblest Pagans
      were all in hell, being deeply impressed with the splendid virtues of the
      emperor Trajan, and begging for his release; a prayer which (the legend
      says) was granted, with a caveat that it should never be repeated. Thus,
      also, we hear of the great Aquinas kneeling all night on the stone floor
      of his cell, passionately beseeching God to save the Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      This revolt against eternal damnation has mightily increased. Civilised
      men and women will not&mdash;positively <i>will</i> not&mdash;be damned at
      the old rate. The clergy are obliged to accommodate their preaching to the
      altered circumstances; hence we hear of "Eternal Hope," and "Ultimate
      Salvation," and similar brands on the new bottles in which they seek to
      pour the diluted old wine of theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archdeacon Farrar is the type of this new school&mdash;at least in the
      Church of England. He is a wealthy pluralist; in addition to which he
      earns a large income as a writer of sentimental books, that immensely
      tickle the flabby souls of "respectable" Christians. Not quite illiterate,
      yet nowise thoughtful, these people are semi-orthodox and temporising.
      They take the old creed with a faint dash of heresy. Hell, at any rate,
      they like to see cooled a bit, or at least shortened; and Archdeacon
      Farrar satisfies them with a Hell which is not everlasting, but only
      eternal. We believe that Dr. Farrar expressed a faint hope that Charles
      Bradlaugh had not gone to hell. It was just possible that he might get a
      gallery seat in the place where the Archdeacon is booked for a stall. Dr.
      Farrar is not sure that all the people who were thought to go to hell
      really go there. He entertains a mild doubt upon the subject. Nor does he
      believe that hell is simply punitive. He thinks it is purgative. After a
      billion years or so the ladies and gentlemen in the pit may hope to be
      promoted to the upper circles. Some of them, however, who are desperate
      and impenitent, and perfectly impervious to the sulphur treatment, will
      have to remain in hell forever. The door will be closed upon them as
      incorrigible and irredeemable; and the saints in heaven will go on
      singing, and harping, and jigging, regardlesss of these obstinate
      wretches, these ultimate failures, these lost souls, these everlasting
      inheritors of perdition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humanity is growing day by day. So is common sense. Every decently
      educated person will soon insist on the abolition of hell. The idea of a
      lost soul will not be tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A theologian of painful genius (in its way) imagined a lost soul in hell.
      He had been agonising for ages. At last he asked a gaoler "What hour is
      it?" and the answer came "Eternity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtful, sensitive men and women, in ever increasing number, loathe
      such teaching, and turn with disgust from those who offer it to their
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not aware that men have souls, but if they have, why should any
      soul be <i>lost</i>? We are not aware that there is a God, but if there
      is, why should he <i>let</i> any soul be lost? Sending souls to hell at
      all is only punishing his own failures. If he is omnipotent he could have
      made them as he pleased, and if they do not please him it is not their
      fault, but his own. Let it be distinctly understood that a creator has no
      right over his creatures; it is the creatures who have a right to the best
      assistance of their creator. The contrary doctrine comes down to us from
      the "good old times" when children had no rights, and parents had absolute
      power of life and death over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way, God had absolute power over his creatures; he was the
      potter and they were the clay; one vessel was made for honor, and one for
      dishonor; one for heaven, and one for hell. But civilisation has changed
      our conceptions. We regard the parent as responsible for the child, and
      God is responsible for the welfare of his creatures. A single "lost soul"
      would prove the malignity or imbecility of "our father which art in
      heaven."

    <h2>
      HAPPY IN HELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Professor St. George Mivart is a very useful man to the Jesuits. He plays
      the jackal to their lion; or, it might be said, the cat to their monkey.
      Some time ago he argued that Catholicism and Darwinism were in the
      happiest agreement; that the Catholic Church was not committed, like the
      Protestant Church, to a cast-iron theory of Inspiration; and that he was
      quite prepared to find that all the real Word of God in the Bible might be
      printed in a very small book and easily carried in a waistcoat pocket.
      That article appeared in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>. In the current
      number of the same review Mr. Mivart has another theological article on
      "Happiness in Hell." He says he took advice before writing it, so he
      speaks with permission, if not with authority. Such an article, being a
      kind of feeler, was better as the work of a layman. If it did not answer,
      the Church was not committed; if it did answer, the Church's professional
      penmen could follow it up with something more decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Mivart perceives, like the Bishop of Chester, that Christianity
      <i>must</i> alter its teaching with respect to Hell, or lose its hold on
      the educated, the thoughtful, and the humane. "Not a few persons," he
      says, "have abandoned Christianity on account of this dogma." The "more
      highly evolved moral perceptions" of to-day are "shocked beyond expression
      at the doctrine that countless multitudes of mankind will burn for ever in
      hell fire, out of which there is no possible redemption." Father
      Pinamonti's <i>Hell Open to Christians</i> is stigmatised as "repulsive,"
      and its pictures as "revolting." Yet it is issued "with authority," and
      Mr. Mivart falls short of the truth in admitting it has never "incurred
      any condemnation." This little fact seems a barrier to his attempt at
      proving that the Catholic Church is not committed to the doctrine of a
      hell of real fire and everlasting agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" wrote Dante over his Inferno, and
      Mr. Mivart allows that "the words truly express what was the almost
      universal belief of Christians for many centuries." That belief flourished
      under the wing of an infallible Church; and now Mr. Mivart, a member of
      this same infallible Church, comes forward to declare that the belief was
      a mistake. Nevertheless, he argues, the clergy of former times did right
      to preach hell hot and strong, stuff it with fire, and keep it burning for
      ever. They had coarse and ignorant people to deal with, and were obliged
      to use realistic language. Besides, it was necessary to exaggerate, in
      order to bring out the infinite contrast between heaven and hell, the
      elect and the reprobates, the saved and the damned. Mr. Mivart maintains,
      therefore, that the old representation of hell "has not caused the least
      practical error or misled anyone by one jot or tittle"&mdash;which is as
      bold, or, as some would say, as impudent a statement as could be well
      conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly stated, Mr. Mivart's contention is that the fire of hell is
      figurative. The pains of damnation, even in the case of the worst of
      sinners, have not been liberally described by Popes and Councils. "What is
      meant by the expression 'hell fire' has never been defined," says Mr.
      Mivart. Perhaps not. There are some things which, for practical purposes,
      do not need definition, and <i>fire</i> is one of them. Nor is it greatly
      to the purpose to say that "Saint Augustine distinctly declares our
      ignorance about it." Saint Augustine was not God Almighty. Ample set-offs
      to this Father may be found in the pages of Dr. Pusey's <i>What is of
      Faith as to Everlasting Punishment?</i> Besides, if fire does not mean
      fire, if torment does not mean torment, and everlasting does not mean
      everlasting, perhaps hell does not mean hell; in which case, it is a waste
      of time to argue about details, when the whole establishment, to use a
      Shakespearian epithet, is simply "tropical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some positive suffering," thinks Mr. Mivart, "will never cease for those
      who have voluntarily and deliberately cast away from them their supreme
      beatitude." Do you want to know what this positive suffering is? Well,
      wait till you get there. All in good time. Whatever it is, the
      "unbelievers" will get <i>their</i> share of it. The editor of the <i>Freethinker</i>
      may look out for a double dose. Professor Huxley will not escape. He is an
      aggressive Agnostic; one of those persons who, in the graceful language of
      Mivartian civility, do not "possess even a rudiment of humility or
      aspiration after goodness." "Surely," exclaims our new Guide to Hell,
      "surely if there is a sin which, on merely Theistic principles, merits the
      severest pains of hell, it is the authorship of an irreligious book."
      Which leads <i>us</i> in turn to exclaim, "Surely, yea thrice surely, will
      hell never be wholly abolished or deprived of its last torture-chamber,
      while Christians require a painful place for those who boldly differ from
      them." Mr. Mivart, it is true, confesses that "those who are disturbed and
      distressed by difficulties about hell include many among the best of
      mankind." But they must not write irreligious books on the subject. They
      must wait, in patience and meekness, until Mr. Mivart gives them
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now summarise Mr. Mivart's position. Uni-versalism, or the final
      restitution of all men, he rejects as "utterly irreconcilable with
      Catholic doctrine." Those who are saved go to heaven&mdash;after various
      delays in purgatory&mdash;and enjoy the Beatific Vision for ever. Those
      who are lost go to hell and remain there for all eternity. They lose the
      Beatific Vision, and that is their chief punishment. But hell is not a
      really dreadful place&mdash;except, of course, for the writers of
      irreligious books. It may have its equator, and perhaps its poles; but
      between them are vast regions of temperate clime and grateful soil. The
      inhabitants are in a kind of harmony with their environment. They are even
      under a law of evolution, and "the existence of the damned is one of
      progress and gradual amelioration." We suppose it may be said, in the
      words of Napoleon, that the road is open to talent; and enterprising
      "damned ones" may cry with truth&mdash;"Better to reign in hell than serve
      in heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hell must be regarded as a most desirable place. Mr. Mivart knows all
      about it, and we have his authority for saying it is "an abode of
      happiness transcending all our most vivid anticipations, so that man's
      natural capacity for happiness is there gratified to the very utmost." And
      this is hell! Well, as the old lady said, who would have thought it?
      Verily the brimstone has all turned to treacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious! is it not? While the Protestants are discussing whether hell-fire
      is actual fire, and whether sinners are roasted for everlasting, or only
      for eternity, in steps a Catholic and declares that hell is a first-class
      sanitarium, far superior to the east-end of London, better than
      Bournemouth, and ahead of Naples and Mentone. "Be happy in heaven," he
      cries, "and if you won't, why, damn you, be happy in hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we leave Mr. Mivart we have a parting word to say. He admits
      the comparative novelty of his view of hell. "Our age," he says, "has
      developed not only a great regard for human life, but also for the
      sufferings of the brute creation." This has led to a moral revolt against
      the old doctrine of eternal torment, and the Church is under the necessity
      of presenting the idea of hell in a fresh and less revolting fashion.
      Precisely so. It is not theology which purifies humanity, but humanity
      which purifies theology. Man civilises himself first, and his gods
      afterwards, and the priest walks at the tail of the procession.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Professor Mivart is a man to be pitied. First of all, his
     views on Hell were opposed by Father Clarke, against whom
     the hell-reformer defended himself. Last of all, however,
     Professor Mivart's articles on this subject were placed upon
     the Index of Prohibited Books, which no good Catholic is
     allowed to read, except by special permission. Rome had
     spoken, and the Professor submitted himself to Holy Mother
     Church. In doing so, he destroyed the value of his judgment
     on any question whatever, since he submits not to argument,
     but to authority.

    <h2>
      THE ACT OF GOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A CURIOUS litigation has just been decided at the Spalding County Court.
      The Great Northern Railway was sued for damages by a farmer, who had sent
      a quantity of potatoes to London shortly before Christmas, which were not
      delivered for nearly ten days, and were then found to be spoiled by the
      frost. The Company's defence was that a dense fog prevailed during the
      Christmas week, and disorganised the traffic; that everything was done to
      facilitate the transit of goods; and that, as the fog was the act of God,
      there was no liability for damage by delay. After an hour's deliberation,
      the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and judgment was given
      them with costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sincerely pity that Lincolnshire farmer. It is very hard lines to
      receive only thirteen and fourpence for four tons of potatoes; and harder
      still to pay the whole of that sum, and a good deal more, for attempting
      to obtain compensation. The poor man is absolutely without a remedy. The
      person who delayed and rotted his potatoes is called God, but no one knows
      where he resides, and it is impossible to serve a summons upon him, even
      if a court of justice would grant one. God appears to be the chartered
      libertine of this planet. He destroys what he pleases, and no one is able
      to make him pay damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians may call this "blasphemous." But calling names is no argument.
      Certainly it will not pay for that farmer's potatoes. We fail to see where
      the blasphemy comes in. An English judge and jury have accepted the Great
      Northern Railway Company's plea that the fog was the act of God. We simply
      take our stand upon their verdict and judgment. And we tell the Christians
      that if God sent the fog&mdash;as the judge and jury allow&mdash;he has a
      great deal more to answer for than four tons of rotted potatoes. That
      terrible fog cost London a gas bill amounting to twenty or thirty thousand
      pounds. It is impossible to estimate the cost to the community of delayed
      traffic and suspended business. Hundreds of people were suffocated or
      otherwise slaughtered. Millions of people were made peevish or brutally
      ill-tempered, and there was a frightful increase of reckless profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons, doubtless, will say that God did <i>not</i> send the fog.
      They will assert that it came in the ordinary course of nature. But does
      nature act independently of God? Is he only responsible for <i>some</i> of
      the things that happen? And who is responsible for the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who still believe in the Devil may conveniently introduce him, it is
      curious, however, that they never do, except in cases of <i>moral</i>
      evil. Criminal indictments charge prisoners with acting wickedly under the
      instigation of the Devil. But <i>physical</i> evil is ascribed to Jehovah.
      Bills of lading exonerate shipowners from liability if anything happens to
      the cargo through "the act of God or the Queen's enemies." Old Nick does
      not raise storms, stir up volcanoes, stimulate earthquakes, blight crops,
      or spread pestilence. All those destructive pastimes are affected by his
      rival. Even cases of sudden death, or death from lightning are brought in
      by jurors as "died by the visitation of God." Which seems to show that a
      visit from God is a certain calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time will come, of course, when all this nonsense about "the act of
      God" will disappear. But it will only dissappear because real belief in
      God is dying. While men are sincere Theists they cannot help seeing God in
      the unexpected and the calamitous. That is how theology began, and that is
      how it must continue while it has a spark of vitality. But theology
      declines as knowledge increases. Our dread of the unknown diminishes as we
      gain command over the forces of nature; that is, our dread of the unknown
      diminishes as we turn it into the <i>known</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The act of God" is to be frustrated by Science. We cannot prevent storms,
      but we are growing more able to foresee them. We cannot prevent the angry
      waves from rising, but we can build ships to defy their fiercest wrath. We
      cannot prevent mist from ascending in certain conditions of sky and soil,
      but we can drain low-lying ground, and prevent the mist from being fatally
      charged with smoke. We cannot abolish the microbes with which our planet
      swarms, and if we could we should be surrounded with intolerable
      putrifaction; but we can observe the laws of public and private
      sanitation, maintain a high state of vitality, and make ourselves
      practically invulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science is the instrument for achieving the triumph of man. Ultimately it
      will subdue the planet for us, and we shall be able to exclaim with Mr.
      Swinburne, "Glory to man in the highest, for man is the master of things."
      The paradise the theologians dream of will be realised on earth. We shall
      not abolish death, but we shall make life strong, rich, and glorious, and
      when death comes it will bring no terror, but rest and peace in the shadow
      of its wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile "the act of God" will to some extent survive in the mental life
      of the multitude. All prayer is based upon this superstition. Those who
      pray for relief or exemption from storm, famine, or disease; those who
      pray to be preserved from "battle, murder, and sudden death"; those who
      pray to be saved from any evil, are, all praying against "the act of God."
      It is God who is sending the mischief, and therefore he is begged to take
      it away or pass it on to other persons. Hamburg would be grateful to God
      even if he transferred the cholera to Berlin. Thus do ignorance and
      selfishness go hand in hand; thus does superstition cloud the intellect
      and degrade the character.

    <h2>
      KEIR HARDIE ON CHRIST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some time the Labor leaders have been assiduously courted by the
      Churches. It is reckoned good business to have one on exhibition at
      Congresses and Conferences. Ben Tillett is in frequent request as a
      preacher. Tom Mann, who was once heterodox, is now declared by the <i>Christian
      Commonwealth</i> to be a member of a Christian Church. "We are not aware,"
      our contemporary says, "that John Burns is opposed to the religion of
      Jesus Christ."
    </p>
    <p>
      This appropriation of the Labor leaders is an excellent piece of strategy.
      Churches have seldom had the harmlessness of doves, but they have
      generally had the cunning of serpents. They often stoop, but always to
      conquer. And this is precisely what they are doing in the present case.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or two ago a leading Socialist, who is also an Atheist, remarked to
      us how the clericals were creeping into the Socialist movement. "Yes," we
      observed, "and they will appropriate and stifle it. They will talk about
      the Socialism of Jesus Christ, bamboozle your followers, and get them out
      of your control. Then the Socialism will gradually disappear, and Jesus
      Christ will be left in sole possession of the field. The clericals, in
      fact, will trump your best cards, if you let them take part in the game."
    </p>
    <p>
      We warn the Labor leaders, whether they listen to us or not, that they are
      coquetting with the historic enemy of the people. All religion is a
      consecration of the past, and every minister is at heart a priest. The
      social and political object of Churches is to keep things as they are; or,
      if they <i>must</i> be altered, to control the alteration in the interest
      of wealth and privilege. Fine words may be uttered and popular sentiments
      may be echoed; but history teaches us that when the leaders of religion
      talk in this way, they are serving their one great purpose as surely as
      when they curse and damn the rebellious multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of events will show whether we are right or wrong. Meanwhile
      let us "return to our sheep." Not that Mr. Keir Hardie is a sheep. We
      don't mean that, though he is certainly being attended to by the wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keir Hardie has been interviewed by the <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>.
      "His father," we are informed, "is a very vigorous and militant Atheist,
      so that the son was brought up without any religious belief." To some
      extent we believe this is true. Mr. Hardie's brother, and another member
      of the family, attended our last lectures at Glasgow. But we do not
      understand that Mr. Keir Hardie was ever a professed Atheist, or a member
      of any Freethought society. The scepticism he was "weaned from" by the
      Evangelical Union Church could hardly have been of a very robust order. He
      seems to have imbibed a sentimental form of Christianity as easily and
      comfortably as a cat laps milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his last election contest the statement was circulated that Mr.
      Keir Hardie was an Atheist. "Whereupon," we are told, "Dr. James Morison,
      the venerable founder of the Evangelical Union, and Dr. Fergus Ferguson,
      of Glasgow, both wrote in the most eulogistic terms to a local clergyman
      as to Mr. Hardie's moral character and religious work in Scotland." This
      is extremely affecting. It is good to see parliamentary candidates walking
      about with certificates of moral character&mdash;written out by a local
      minister. It is also reassuring to find that such a certificate is an
      absolute answer to the charge of Atheism, No doubt Mr. Keir Hardie will
      print the testimonial as a postscript to his next election address at West
      Ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keir Hardie calls himself a Christian. He does not say, however, if he
      believes in the supernatural part of the Gospels. Does he accept the New
      Testament miracles? Does he embrace the Incarnation and Resurrection? If
      he does, he is a Christian. If he does not, he has no more right to call
      himself a Christian than we have to be designated a Buddhist or a
      Mohammedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christianity of the schools, Mr. Keir Hardie says, is dead or dying.
      By this he means "the old theological sects." But here we should like him
      to be more explicit. Does he think there can be a Christianity <i>without</i>
      "theology"? Or does he mean that the "sects" comprise all persons who have
      more theology than himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the Christianity of the schools is dead or dying, the "humanitarian
      Christianity of Christ is again coming to the front." Now what <i>is</i>
      this humanitarian Christianity of Christ? Upon this point Mr. Keir Hardie
      throws but a single ray of light. "The whole of Christ's teachings and
      conduct," he says, "proves that he was intensely interested in the bodily
      welfare of those with whom he came in contact as a preparative to their
      spiritual well-being." This is a clear statement; all we now want is the
      clear proof. Mr. Keir Hardie should give it. We believe he cannot; nay, we
      defy him to do so. It is idle to cite the so-called "miracles of healing."
      They were occasional and special; they had as much effect on the "bodily
      welfare" of the Jewish people as tickling has on the gait of an elephant;
      and as for their being a "preparative to spiritual well-being," we may ask
      the "humanitarian Christians of Christ" to tell us, if they can, how much
      of this quality was afterwards displayed by the ladies and gentlemen who
      were the lucky subjects (or objects) of Christ's miracles. Mr. Keir Hardie
      might also recollect that the said miracles, if they ever happened, are of
      no "bodily" importance to the present generation. Humanitarians of to-day
      are unable to work miracles; they have to sow the seed of progress, and
      await its natural harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keir Hardie is undoubtedly an earnest social reformer. We wish him all
      success in his efforts to raise the workers and procure for them a just
      share of the produce of their industry. Some of his methods may be
      questionable without affecting his sincerity. If we all saw eye to eye
      there would be no problems to settle. What we object to is the fond
      imagination that any light upon the labor question, or any actual social
      problem, can be found in the teachings of Christ. Jesus of Nazareth never
      taught industry, or forethought, or any of the robuster virtues of
      civilisation. On one occasion he said that his kingdom was not of this
      world. He might certainly have said so of his teaching. It is all very
      well for Mr. Keir Hardie to assert that our "industrial system is foreign
      to the spirit of Christianity." What <i>is</i> the spirit of Christianity?
      Twenty different things in as many different minds. <i>Some</i> industrial
      system is a necessity, and whatever it is you will never find its real
      principles in the Gospels. Christ's one social panacea was "giving to the
      poor," and this is the worst of all "reformations." It only disguises
      social evils. The world could do very well without "charity" if it only
      had justice and common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Bradlaugh, the Atheist, was laughed at for advocating the
      compulsory cultivation of waste lands. He wanted to see labor and capital
      employed upon them, even if they yielded no rent to landlords. Mr. Keir
      Hardie, the Christian, also desires to bring the people into "contact with
      nature and mother earth," though his recipe, of "open spaces laid down in
      grass" seems ludicrously inadequate. The loss of this contact, he told his
      interviewer, is "accountable for much of the Atheism which is a natural
      product of city life." This "tender thought" was spoken in a voice "which
      sank almost to a whisper." Very naturally it struck the interviewer as
      "the finest and most beautiful of Mr. Hardie's utterances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the interviewer and Mr. Keir Hardie forgot a fact of Christian
      history. Christianity spread in the towns of the Roman Empire. The pagans
      were the villagers&mdash;<i>paganus</i> meaning a countryman or rustic.
      Possibly some of the pagans said to themselves, "Ah, this Christianity is
      a natural product of the towns."
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagnosis is in both cases empirical. In a certain sense, however, Mr.
      Keir Hardie has touched a truth. Progressive ideas must always originate
      in the keen life of cities. But in another sense Mr. Keir Hardie is
      mistaken. He seems to regard Atheism as a city malady, like rickets and
      anemia. Now this is untrue. It is also absurd. Mr. Keir Hardie would find
      a good many of these "afflicted" Atheists able to make mincemeat of his
      "humanitarian Christianity of Christ." He would also find, if he cared to
      look, a great many of them in the Socialist camp. It would be rare sport
      to see Mr. Keir Hardie defending his "new school" Christianity against the
      young bloods of the Fabian Society, though it might necessitate the
      interference of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we do not wish to part from Mr. Keir Hardie in a spirit of sarcasm. If
      he is a hopeless sentimentalist there is no more to be said; but, if he is
      capable of reason in matters of religion, we appeal to him, in all
      sincerity, not to press the new wine of Humanitarianism into the old
      bottles of Christianity. He will only break the bottles and lose the wine.
      We also implore him to cease talking nonsense about Christianity being "a
      life, and not a doctrine." It never can be the one without the other.
      Finally, we beg him to consider what is the real value of Christianity if,
      after all these centuries, it is necessary to put "humanitarian" in front
      of it, in order to give it a chance in decent society.

    <h2>
      BLESSED BE YE POOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A leading London newspaper, the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, has recently
      opened it columns to a discussion of the question, "Is Christianity Played
      Out?" Mr. Robert Buchanan thinks that it is, and we are of the same
      opinion. But in a certain sense Christianity is <i>not</i> played out. To
      use a common expression, "there's money in it." That is incontestable.
      Despite the "poverty" of the "lower clergy," for whom so many appeals are
      made, the clerical business beats all others, if we compare the amount of
      investment with the size of the dividend. Relatively speaking, the profits
      are magnificent. There are curates with only a workman's wages, and of
      course they merit our deepest sympathy. It is quite shocking to think that
      a disciple of the "<i>poor</i> Carpenter of Nazareth" has to subsist, and
      support his ten children, on such a miserable pittance. It is a calamity
      which calls for tears of blood. But, on the other hand, there are
      Archbishops with princely incomes, Bishops with lordly revenues, Deans and
      Canons with fine salaries and snug quarters; and between the two extremes
      of the fat bishop and the lean curate is a long line of gradations, in
      which, if we strike an average, the result is very far from despicable. It
      may be added that while the leading Nonconformist ministers, at least in
      England, do not rival the great Church dignitaries in the matter of
      income, they often run up to a thousand a year and sometimes over it.
      Taking the average of their incomes, we have no hesitation in saying it is
      beyond what they would earn in the ordinary labor market. Still, so far as
      they are not paid by the State, as the Church clergy <i>are</i>, we have
      no personal reason for complaint. This is a free country&mdash;especially
      for Christians; and if the lay disciples of the poor Carpenter like to pay
      his professional apostles a fancy price for their work, it is no concern
      of ours from a business point of view. Nevertheless, as the said apostles
      are <i>public</i> men, who set up as other people's <i>teachers</i>, we
      have a right to express an opinion as to the consistency between their
      preaching and their practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our gallant colleague, Joseph Symes, who is nobly upholding the
      Freethought banner in Australia, once asked, "Who's to be Damned if
      Christianity is True?" Certainly, he said, the clergy stand a fine chance.
      They are more likely to go to Hades than the congregations they preach to.
      On on average they are better off. They preach, or <i>should</i> preach,
      the blessings of poverty, and the curse, nay, the damnableness, of wealth.
      According to the teaching of Jesus, as we read it in the Sermon on the
      Mount, and as we find it illustrated in the parable of Dives and Lazarus,
      every pauper is pretty sure of a front seat in heaven; and every man of
      property or good income is equally sure of warm quarters in hell. But you
      do not meet parsons in workhouses, though some of them get a good deal of
      outdoor relief. Go into a country parish and look for the clergyman's
      house; you will not find it difficult to discover. The best residence is
      the squire's, the next best is the parson's. Everywhere the clericals
      appropriate as much as they can of the good things of this world. They
      find it quite easy to worship God and Mammon together. The curate has his
      eye on a vicarage; the vicar has his on a deanery; the dean has his on a
      bishopric. The Dissenting minister is open to improve his position.
      Sometimes he is invited to another church. He wrestles with the Lord, and
      makes inquiries. If they prove satisfactory, he recognises "a call." Other
      people, in ordinary business, would honestly say they were accepting a
      better situation; but the man of God is above all that, so he obeys the
      Lord's voice and goes to a position of "greater service," though it would
      puzzle him to show an extra soul saved by the exchange. Yes, the poor
      Carpenter's apostles strive to make the best of this world, and take their
      chance of the next. They are wise in their generation; they resemble the
      serpent in the text, however they neglect the dove. And for all these
      things God shall bring them into account&mdash;that is, if the gospel be
      true; for nothing is more certain, according to the gospel, than that the
      poor will be saved, and those who are not poor will be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Disraeli called the Conservative government of Sir Robert Peel
      "an organised hypocrisy." Modern Christianity appears to us to merit the
      same description. The note of modern apologetics is the phrase of
      "Christ-like." In one respect the gentlemen who strike this note <i>are</i>
      Christ-like. They live on the gifts of the faithful, including those of
      "rich women." But the likeness ends there. In other respects they are
      dissimilar to their Master. He <i>died</i> upon the cross, and they <i>live</i>
      upon the cross. Yes, and many of them get far more on the cross than they
      would ever get on the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless we shall be censured in vigorous biblical language for speaking
      so plainly. But we mean every word we say, and are prepared to make it
      good in discussion. Men should practise what they preach. Those who teach
      that poverty is a blessing should themselves be poor. Those who teach that
      God Almighty cried "Woe unto you rich!" should avoid the curse of wealth.
      If they do not, they are hypocrites. It is no use mincing the matter.
      Plain speech is best on such occasions. When the great Dr. Abernethy told
      a gouty, dyspeptic, rich patient to "live on sixpence a day and earn it,"
      his advice was more wholesome than the most dexterous rigmarole.

      Nothing could better show than the conduct of the clergy that Christianity
      <i>is</i> played out, if it means the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount.
      Those who preach it cannot practise it; what is more, they do not mean to.
      The late Archbishop of York, while Bishop of Peterborough, wrote a
      magazine article on this Sermon on the Mount, in which he urged that any
      Society that was based upon it would go to ruin in a week. He was paid at
      that time £4,500 a year to-preach this Sermon on the Mount, and he did so&mdash;in
      the pulpit; then he mounted another rostrum, and cried, "For God's sake
      don't practise it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed be ye poor" and "Woe unto you rich" are texts with which the
      Church has bamboozled the multitude in the interest of the privileged
      classes. The disinherited sons of earth were promised all sorts of fine
      compensations in Kingdom-Come; meanwhile kings, aristocrats, priests, and
      all the rest of the juggling and appropriating tribe, battened on the
      fruits of other men's labor. The poor were like the dog crossing the
      stream, and seeing the big shadow of his piece of meat in the water.
      "Seize the shadow!" the priests cried. The poor did so. But the
      substance-was not lost. It was snapped up and shared by priestcraft and
      privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people have been told that the gospel is a cheap thing&mdash;without
      money and without price. That is the prospectus. But the gospel is
      frightfully dear in reality. Religion costs more than education. England
      spends more in preparing her sons and daughters for the next world than in
      training them for this world. Yet the next world may be nothing but a
      dream, and certainly we <i>know</i> nothing about it; while this world is
      a solid and often a solemn fact, with its business as well as its
      pleasures, its work as well as its enjoyments, its duties as well as its
      privileges. To keep people out of hell, and guide them to heaven (places
      that only exist in the map of faith), we spend over twenty millions a
      year. This is a sum which, if wisely devoted, would remedy the worst evils
      of human society in a single generation. It would found countless
      institutions of culture and innocent recreation; and, by means of
      experiments, it would solve a host of social problems. Instead of doing
      this, we keep up a huge army of black-coats to fight an imaginary Devil;
      yet we call ourselves a <i>practical</i> people. Christianity has it
      roots-deep down in the <i>wealth</i> of England, and this is the secret of
      its power, allied of course with its usurped authority over the minds of
      little children. The-churches and chapels are mostly social institutions,
      Sunday resorts of the "respectable" classes. For any purpose connected
      with the real welfare of the people Christianity might just as well be
      dead and buried&mdash;as it will be when the people see the truth.

    <h2>
      CONVERTED INFIDELS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christian logic is a curious thing. There is nothing like it, we should
      imagine, in the heavens above or the waters under the earth. Certainly
      there is nothing like it on the earth itself, unless we make an exception
      in the case of Christian veracity, which is as much like Christian logic
      as one cherry is like another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a long time since Christians began arguing&mdash;it would be an
      outrage on the dictionary to call it reasoning. They have been at it for
      nearly two thousand years. Their founder, Jesus Christ, seldom argued. He
      uttered himself dogmatically at most times; occasionally he spoke in
      parables; and whenever he was cornered he escaped on a palpable evasion.
      His great disciple, Paul, however, was particularly fond of arguing. His
      writings abound in "for" and "whereas." The argument he most affected was
      the circular one. He could run round a horseshoe, skip over from point to
      point, and run round again as nimbly as any man on record. In a famous
      chapter in Corinthians, for instance, he first proves the resurrection of
      the dead by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and then proves the
      resurrection of Jesus Christ by the resurrection of the dead. It is in the
      same chapter that he enunciates the botanical truth (a truth of Bible
      botany, observe) that a seed does not bear anything unless it dies.
      Altogether the great Apostle is a first-rate type of the Christian
      logician, and there are some who declare him to be a first-rate type of
      the Christian truth-teller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speeding down the stream of time to the present age, we see that Christian
      logic (yes, and Christian veracity) has undergone little if any
      alteration. It is as infantile and as impudent as ever. Arguments that
      would look fallacious in the nursery are used in the pulpit, generation
      after generation, with an air of solemn profundity, as though they were as
      wise as the oracles of omniscience. To select from such a plethora is
      almost impossible; the difficulty is where to begin. But happily we are
      under no necessity of selection. A case is before us, and we take it as it
      comes. It is a "converted infidel" case, in the report of a recent sermon&mdash;the
      last of a series on "Is Christianity Played Out?"&mdash;by the Rev. Dr.
      Hiles Hitchens; the gentleman referred to in one of our last week's
      paragraphs as wishing for an old three-legged stool or something made by
      Jesus Christ. Dr. Hitchens, alas! cannot find the stool, and has to put up
      with the creed instead; though, perhaps, he gets as much out of the creed
      as he would make by selling the stool to the British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hitchens preached from the text, "The earth shall be full of the
      knowledge of the Lord"&mdash;a statement which, after the lapse of so many
      centuries, has still to be couched in the future tense. The delay has been
      excessive, but Dr. Hitchens is hopeful. He believes in the ultimate and
      speedy fulfilment of the prophecy. One of his grounds for so believing is
      this (we quote from the <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>), that "Out of 20
      leading lecturers, authors, editors, and debaters on the side of
      Infidelity 17 have been brought to Christ within the last 30 years, have
      left their infidel associations, openly professed the religion of Jesus,
      and engaged in Christian work." The last he named, we are told, was "the
      case of a National Secular lecturer, of whom the sceptics were greatly
      proud, who has recently been received by, and now lectures for, the
      Christian Evidence Society."
    </p>
    <p>
      We leave the consideration of these "facts" for a moment, and deal in the
      first place with Dr. Hitchens's peculiar logic. It is truly Christian. The
      species is unmistakable. Seventeen Freethinkers have been converted to
      Christianity! Wonderful! But how many Christians have been converted to
      Freethought? Ay, there's the rub. For every specimen Dr. Hitchens produces
      we will produce a thousand. Not only were the rank and file of the
      Freethought party very largely brought up as Christians, but its leaders
      are of the same category. Charles Bradlaugh was brought up as a Christian,
      so was Colonel Ingersoll. Can Dr. Hitchens produce two names among his
      "converts" of the same weight, or a half, a quarter, or a tithe of it?
      Every leader of Freethought in England, we believe, is a convert from
      Christianity. As to the "leading" men Dr. Hitchens refers to, we presume
      they are the persons initialed in the late Mr. Whitmore's tract, and those
      among them who were leaders were not converted, and those who were
      converted were not leaders. The real leaders of the Freethought party,
      those who were long in its service, and were entrusted with power and
      responsibility, were never converted. And the cases on Mr. Whitmore's list
      are old. They have an ancient and fish-like smell. Dr. Hitchens will
      perhaps be good enough to tell us the name of any man of real distinction
      in the Freethought party who has been "converted" during the last twenty
      years. We defy him to do so. If he goes back far enough he will find a few
      men who were not trusted in our party, and a few weaklings who could not
      fight an uphill battle, who went over to the enemy. Real leaders of our
      party fought, suffered, and starved, but they never deserted the flag.
      Christianity could not convert a Bradlaugh or a Holyoake; it could only
      bribe or allure a Sexton or a Gordon, or others of the "illustrious
      obscure" in Mr. Whitmore's fraudulent catalogue. In short, the
      "conversions" to Christianity so trumpeted are mostly dubious, generally
      insignificant, and all ancient. If the prophecy which Dr. Hitchens
      preached from is to be accomplished, it will have to quicken its rate of
      fulfilment during the past twenty years. We convert tremendously more
      Christians than you do Freethinkers; the balance is terribly to your
      disadvantage; you can only make out a promising account by setting down
      your infinitesimal gains and making no entry of your tremendous losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only recent case that Dr. Hitchens refers to is that of "a National
      Secular lecturer, of whom the sceptics were greatly proud." Dr. Hitchens
      evidently takes this gentleman at his own estimate. That <i>he</i> thinks
      the sceptics were greatly proud of him is intelligible; it is quite in
      keeping with his shallow, vulgar, And egotistical nature. But the truth is
      "the sceptics," in any general sense, were <i>not</i> proud of him. He was
      a very young man, with a great deal to learn, who had a very brief career
      as a Secularist in East London. In a thoughtless moment a local Secular
      Society gave him office, and that fact is his entire stock-in-trade as a
      "converted Freethinker." He was never one of the National Secular
      Society's appointed lecturers; he was neither "author, editor, or
      debater"; and he was utterly unknown to the party in general. Dr. Hitchens
      has, in fact, discovered a mare's nest. We are in a position to speak with
      some authority, and we defy him to name any Freethinker "of whom the
      sceptics were greatly proud" who has of late years been converted to
      Christianity. It is easy enough to impose on an ignorant congregation, and
      Dr. Hitchens is probably aware of the lengths to which a reckless
      pulpiteer may carry his mendacity. But candid investigators will conclude
      that "converted infidels" cannot be very plentiful, when the majority of
      them are so ancient; nor very important, when an obscure youth has to be
      advertised as "a leader" of whom the sceptics (nine out of ten of them
      never having heard of him) were "greatly proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      We should imagine that Dr. Hitchens is rather new to this line of
      advocacy. In the course of time he will learn&mdash;if indeed he has not
      already learnt, and is concealing the fact&mdash;that the "converted
      infidels" will not stand a minute's scrutiny. The only safe method is to
      drop questionable cases and resort to sheer invention. Even that method,
      however, is not devoid of peril, as one of its practitioners has recently
      discovered. The Rev. Hugh Price Hughes must by this time be extremely
      sorry he circulated that false and foolish story of the converted Atheist
      shoemaker. The exposure of it follows him wherever he goes, and
      illustrates the truth of at least one Bible text&mdash;"Be sure your sin
      will find you out."

    <h2>
      MRS. BOOTH'S GHOST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Booth family have all keen eyes for business. If they shut their eyes
      you can see it by their noses. It is not surprising, therefore, to find
      Mrs. Booth-Tucker capping Mr. Stead's ghost stories with a fine romance
      about her dead mother. While the "Mother of the Salvation Army" was dying,
      the Booth family made all the capital they could out of her sufferings;
      and when she expired, her corpse was shunted about in the financial
      interest of their show. Perhaps they would be exhibiting her still if
      there were no law as to the disposition of corpses. But as that avenue to
      profit is closed, the only alternative is to make use of Mrs. Booth's
      ghost, and this has just been done by one of her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Booth-Tucker contributes her ghost story to the Easter number of <i>All
      the World</i>. No doubt Easter was thought a seasonable time for its
      publication. Christians are just then dreaming about the great Jerusalem
      ghost, and another "creeper" comes in appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stead catches up Mrs. Booth-Tucker's ghost story and prints it in the
      <i>Review of Reviews</i>. He admits the want of evidence "as to its
      objectivity," which is a euphemism for "no evidence at all," and then
      observes most sapiently that if it was only a dream, "the coincidence of
      its occurrence at the crisis in her illness is remarkable"&mdash;which is
      precisely what it is not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Booth-Tucker was very ill on board a steamer when she saw her mother,
      fresh from "the beautiful land above." "Those with me," she says, "thought
      I was dying, and I thought so too." When a person is in that state, after
      a wasting illness, the brain is necessarily weak. But this was not all. "I
      had not slept," the lady says, "for some days, at any rate not for many
      minutes together." Her brain, therefore, was not only weak, but
      overwrought; and in ingenuously stating this at the outset the lady gives
      herself away. Given a wasted body, weakness "unto death," a brain ill
      supplied with blood and ravaged with sleeplessness; does it, we ask,
      require a "rank materialist" to explain the presence of "visions" without
      the aid of supernaturalism?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suddenly," Mrs. Booth-Tucker says, "I saw her coming to me." But how
      "coming"? The lady tells us she was lying in "a small sea cabin." This
      does not leave much room for the "coming" of the ghost. We should also
      like to know why a lady thought to be dying was <i>left alone</i>. It is
      certainly a very unusual circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Booth's ghost, after as much "coming" as could be accomplished in "a
      small cabin," at last "sat beside" her sick daughter "on the narrow bunk."
      No doubt the seat was rather incommodious, but why should a ghost sit at
      all? It really seems to have been a mixed sort of ghost. Apparently it
      came through the ship's side, or the deck, or the cabin-door, or the
      key-hole; yet it was solid enough to touch Mrs. Booth-Tucker's hand and
      kiss her? Nay, it was solid enough to carry on a long conversation, which
      does not seem possible without lungs and larynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Booth's ghost said a great deal. "<i>Wonderful words</i> they were,"
      says Mrs. Booth-Tucker. This whets our curiosity. We are always listening
      for "wonderful words." But, alas, we are doomed to disappointment. The
      lady knows her mother's words were "wonderful," but she cannot reproduce
      them. Here memory is defective. "I can remember so few of the actual
      words," she says. Nevertheless, she gives us a few samples, and they do
      not seem <i>very</i> "wonderful." Here are two of the said samples: "Live,
      live, live, remembering that night comes always <i>quickly</i>, and all is
      nothingness that dies with death!" "Fight the fight, darling; the sympathy
      of Christ is always with you, and every effort you make is heaping up
      treasure for you in Heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      We fancy we have heard those "wonderful words" before. For all their
      wonderfulness, ghosts are seldom original. Mrs. Booth-Tucker reminds us of
      the gushing lady novelist, who describes her hero as divinely handsome and
      miraculously clever, but when she opens his mouth, makes him talk like a
      jackass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "General" Booth's daughter does not see that she found words for her
      mother's ghost. She is not so sharp as Dr. Johnson, who carried on a
      discussion with an adversary in a dream, and got the worst of it. For a
      time he felt humiliated, but he recovered his pride on reflecting that he
      had provided the other fellow with arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Booth-Tucker tells that "the radiance of her face spoke to me,"
      we can easily understand the subjective nature of her "vision," and as
      readily dispense with a budget of those "wonderful words."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor are we singular in incredulity. Mr. Stead cannot put his tongue in his
      cheek at a member of the Booth family, but the <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>
      says "the story is both improbable and absurd," and adds, "it is just such
      fanaticism as this that brings religion into contempt with many educated
      people." Our pious contemporary, like any wretched materialist, declares
      that many persons have seen ghosts "when under the influence of fever or
      in a low state of health."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is sensible enough, and in a Christian journal very edifying. But
      if our pious contemporary only applied this criticism backwards, what
      havoc it would make with the records of early Christianity! Mrs.
      Booth-Tucker is not in all points like Mary Magdalene, but she resembles
      her in fervor of disposition. Out of Mary Magdalene we are told that Jesus
      cast "seven devils," which implies, rationalistically, that she was
      strongly hysterical. She was more likely to be a victim of "fanaticism"
      than Mrs. Booth-Tucker. Yet the ghost story of Mrs. Booth's daughter is
      discredited, and even stigmatised as discreditable, while the brain-sick
      fancies of Mary Magdalene are treated as accurate history. She was at the
      bottom of the Jerusalem ghost story, and her evidence is regarded as
      unimpeachable. So much do circumstances alter cases!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our pious contemporary regards all modern ghosts as "fever dreams." So do
      we, and we regard all ancient ghosts in the same light The difference
      between ancient and modern superstition is only a question of environment.
      Superstition itself is always the same; it no more changes than the
      leopard's spots or the Ethiopian's skin. But the environment changes. From
      the days when there was no scientific knowledge or rigorous criticism we
      have advanced to an age when the electric search-light of science sweeps
      every corner and criticism is remorseless. Hence the modern ghosts are
      served up in Christmas "shockers," while the ancient ghosts are worshipped
      as gods. But this will not last for ever. The rule of "what is, has been,"
      will eventually be applied to the whole of human history, and the greatest
      ghost of the creeds will "melt into the infinite azure of the past."

    <h2>
      TALMAGE ON THE BIBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Talmage is the Spurgeon of America. He has all the English preacher's
      vogue as well as his orthodoxy. But he resembles Spurgeon with a
      difference. He is distinctly American. No one equals the Yankee at "tall
      talk," and what Yankee equals Talmage in this species of composition? The
      oracle of the Brooklyn Tabernacle licks creation in that line. Here is a
      specimen of his spread-eagle eloquence, taken from the sermon we are about
      to criticise:&mdash;"The black and deep-toned bell of doom hangs over
      their heads, and I take the hammer of that bell, and I strike it three
      times with all my might, and it sounds Woe! Woe! Woe!" Perhaps it does,
      but Talmage is wrong in his spelling. What the bell of doom, so impudently
      struck by this mannikin, really sounds is doubtless "Woh! Woh! Woh!" It
      wants the presumptuous spouter to leave off playing the part of God
      Almighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over in America, as well as here in England, the Bible is meeting with
      misfortune. Christian ministers are showing up its blunders and
      inconsistencies. Its foes are now of its own household. Talmage is not
      frightened, however; he keeps a stiff upper-lip; and it must be admitted,
      he has a good deal of upper-lip to keep stiff. Since he visited the Holy
      Land his faith is strong enough to swallow whales. Now he knows that what
      the Bible says is true.. He has seen the place where it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      But faith is a tender plant. Talmage says it is easily destroyed. "I can
      give you a recipe for its obliteration," he cries; and it is this&mdash;"Read
      infidel books; have long and frequent conversations with sceptics; attend
      the lectures of those antagonistic to religion." Yes, faith <i>is</i> a
      tender plant. The believer is a hot-house production. He dies in the
      open-air. The Bible can be read by Freethinkers, and it confirms them in
      their scepticism; but if a Christian reads infidel books he is lost.
      Hearing the other side is fatal to his faith. It is Talmage who states so,
      and, as old Omar Khayyam says, he knows, he knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat paradoxically&mdash;but who expects logic from the pulpit?&mdash;the
      great Talmage declares, "I do not believe there is an infidel now alive
      who has read the Bible through." He offers a hundred dollars reward to any
      infidel "who has read the Bible through twice"&mdash;which discounts his
      certainty that no infidel had read it through <i>once</i>. A good many
      infidels might apply for that hundred dollars, but Talmage will never hand
      it over. An infidel's word is not good enough&mdash;not for Talmage. "I
      must have the testimony," he exclaims, "of someone who has seen him read
      it all through twice." A very safe condition! for who has ever <i>seen</i>
      any man read the Bible through? And if the witness happened to be an
      infidel&mdash;as is likely&mdash;Talmage would want the testimony of
      someone else who had seen him see the other man reading it; Talmage is not
      very wise, but he is not exactly a fool, and he and <i>his</i> money are
      <i>not</i> soon parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an "infidel" in America who <i>has</i> read the Bible through.
      His name is Robert G. Ingersoll. Talmage should discuss the Bible with
      him. But he won't. He knows what his fate would be in such an encounter.
      "And they gathered up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an "infidel" in England who has read the Bible through. <i>More</i>
      than one, of course, but we know this one so intimately. He was shut up in
      Holloway Gaol for knowing too much about the Bible. During the first eight
      weeks of his sojourn there the "blessed book" was his only companion. It
      was the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible. That prisoner
      read it through from the first mistake in Genesis to the last curse in
      Revelation; read it through as Talmage <i>never</i> did, for there were no
      distractions, no letters to answer, no morning and evening newspapers, no
      visitors dropping in. It was a continuous, undisturbed reading, and the
      man who did it would be happy to let the public decide whether he does not
      know the Bible as well as Talmage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talmage has a very poor opinion of infidels. He thinks that "bad habits"
      have much to do with scepticism. His narrow little mind cannot understand
      how anyone can differ from him without being wicked. Still, for decency
      sake, he makes exceptions. "Mind you," he cries, "I do not say that all
      infidels are immoral." How kind! How generous! No doubt the infidels will
      shed tears of gratitude. They are not <i>all</i> immoral. Some of them may
      be nearly as good as Talmage. Certainly some of them are not so
      avaricious. Infidels speakers don't insist on having fifty pounds paid in
      the ante-room before they mount the platform to deliver a lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that Talmage once knew a "pronounced infidel." He was the
      father of one of the Presidents of the United States. Talmage accepted an
      invitation to spend a night in his house. "Just before retiring at night,
      he said, in a jocose way: 'I suppose you are accustomed to read the Bible
      before going to bed, and here is my Bible from which to read. He then told
      me what portions he would like to have me read, and he only asked for
      those portions on which he could easily be facetious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Talmage gives himself away in this observation. He contends that God wrote
      the Bible. Why, then, did God write it so that you could <i>easily</i> be
      facetious about it? It is not so <i>easy</i> to be facetious about Homer,
      or Plato, or Aristotle, or Dante, or Spinoza, or Shakespeare, or Bacon.
      There is no humor in the Bible, no wit, and only a little sarcasm. We do
      not laugh <i>with</i> it, but <i>at</i> it, which is the most fatal form
      of laughter. It is awfully solemn, but dreadfully absurd. There are things
      in it to tickle an elephant. Surely it is strange that God should write a
      book that lends itself so easily to ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spurgeon of Yankeeland goes on to speak about the "internal evidence"
      of the Bible. This he says is "paramount," though he takes care to skip
      off as quickly as possible to outside testimony. He cites a number of
      persons trained up as Christians in favor of the "supernatural" character
      of the Bible. The first is Chief Justice Chase, of the Supreme Court of
      the United States&mdash;against whom we put a great jurisprudist like
      Bentham, and a great judge like Sir James Stephen. The second is President
      Adams&mdash;against whom we put President Lincoln. The third is Sir Isaac
      Newton&mdash;against whom we put Charles Darwin. The fourth is Sir Walter
      Scott&mdash;against whom we put Byron and Shelley. The fifth is Hugh
      Miller&mdash;against whom we put Sir Charles Lyell. The sixth is Edmund
      Burke&mdash;against whom we put Thomas Paine, or, if that will not do,
      Lord Bolingbroke. The seventh is Mr. Gladstone&mdash;against whom we put
      John Morley. "Enough! Enough!" says Talmage. We say so too. Our names
      quite balance his names collectively. The game of "authorities" can be
      played on both sides. But is it worth playing at all? Is a great name a
      substitute for argument? Is authority as good as evidence? Should the jury
      decide according to the eminence of the pleader's friends, or according to
      his facts and the force of his reasoning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of his congregation's ignorance, or exposing his own,
      Talmage declares that "The discovered monuments of Egypt have chiselled on
      them the story of the sufferings of the Israelites in Egyptian bondage, as
      we find it in the Bible." Now, to put it mildly, this is not true. We are
      also told that "the sulphurous graves of Sodom and Gomorrah have been
      identified." To put it mildly again, <i>this</i> is not true. We are told
      next that "the remains of the Tower of Babel have been found." This is not
      true. Assyrian documents are also said to "echo and re-echo the truth of
      Bible history," This is not true, according to Professor Sayce, who knows
      more about Assyrian history than Talmage knows about all things
      whatsoever. The witness of Assyria repeatedly contradicts the Bible story,
      not merely in small matters, but in important features. The fact is,
      Talmage does not know what he is talking about; or, he <i>does</i> know
      what he is talking about, in which case he is playing a very dirty trick
      on his hearers' credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the Pentateuch, it does not trouble Talmage whether it was
      written by "Moses or Hilkiah or Ezra or Samuel or Jeremiah, or another
      group of ancients." He declares that "none of them wrote it," for "God
      wrote the Pentateuch"&mdash;that is to say, they "put down only what God
      dictated; he signed it afterward." But where is the signature? And what a
      paltry way is this of evading the question at issue! It is all very well
      to say that the writers of the Pentateuch were "Jehovah's stenographers or
      typewriters." What we want to know first of all is, who they were, and
      when they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to follow Talmage any farther. Suffice it to say that he
      winds up by warning young Christians against a "Voltaire cyclone" on the
      one side, and a "Tom Paine cyclone" on the other side. There is something
      worse than either&mdash;a Talmage puddle. The young man who sports in that
      is only fit for&mdash;well, Exeter Hall, or Colney Hatch.

    <h2>
      MRS. BESANT ON DEATH AND AFTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we first criticised Mrs. Besant's newly-found Theosophy, and thereby
      incurred her severe displeasure, we predicted that her enthusiastic nature
      would carry her far on the road, which she thought of true philosophy, but
      which we thought of gross superstition. Our prediction has been realised;
      and, unless for some accident, or some sudden turn in Mrs. Besant's mind
      or life, it will be realised still further. In this, as in other matters
      (as the French say) it is the first step which costs, because it involves
      all the following steps. Mrs. Besant placed her feet upon the high road of
      credulity when she succumbed to the Theosophical high priestess, whose
      life is a highly interesting and instructive chapter in the history of
      imposture. Madame Blavatsky had seen much of the world, and was up to most
      things. She had a surprising power of bamboozling people of some
      intelligence and culture. The broad-set eyes, and the great tiger-bar
      between and over them, indicated the species to which she belonged. Mrs.
      Besant, with her innocences and enthusiasms, was a baby in the hands of
      this female Cagliostro. She actually gave the Blavatsky credit for what
      she obviously did not possess. Her manners, for instance, were not such as
      might be expected from one who had tasted of spiritual wisdom at its
      secret sources; while her pretentious ignorance was enough to alarm any
      student not under the glamor of her audacity. She made the most grotesque
      mistakes in science, while pompously setting right in their own province
      such colossal authorities as Darwin and Haeckel. She had certainly read
      very widely (or got others to read very widely for her) in "occult"
      literature; but wherever one's own knowledge enabled one to test, she was
      a poor smatterer; and the same judgment is delivered upon her by
      specialists in most of the fields she invaded. It was not her learning or
      her intellectual power that captivated Mrs. Besant; it was her strong
      personality, her masculine dominance, her crafty self-possession. From the
      first minute of her enchantment, Mrs. Besant lost all sense of logic in
      relation to Theosophy. For instance, it was asserted, and the assertion
      was supported by positive, detailed-evidence, that the Blavatsky had
      practised the grossest imposture in India. And how did Mrs. Besant dispose
      of these charges? She says she read them, and immediately joined the
      Theosophical Society&mdash;as though that were any <i>answer</i>. It is
      like saying, "I don't rebut the evidence against the prisoner in the dock,
      but I shall shake hands with him." What possible effect could that have on
      the sensible part of the jury? But this sort of logic has been displayed
      by Mrs. Besant ever since; indeed, she seems to have a dim perception of
      her weakness, for she dares not discuss Theosophy, or any part of it, with
      an out-and-out Freethinker&mdash;one who would subject it to the critical
      tests with which she herself was familiar when she stood upon the Secular
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one aspect of Mrs. Besant's advocacy of Theosophy which we
      censured at first, and which we now think is something short of honest.
      Mrs. Besant used to present Secularism in its naked truth, to be embraced
      or rejected; but she follows a different course in regard to Theosophy;
      she puts its plausible features forward and conceals the rest, so that
      people who have heard her are positively astonished when they are told of
      some of her printed teachings. This seems especially the case when she
      addresses meetings, somewhat too chivalrously organised by Freethinkers.
      Now this is not fair, it is not really honest; though it may be in accord
      with the ethics of those who divide truth into "exoteric" and "esoteric."
      To our mind, it is rather suggestive of the spider and the fly. "Will you
      walk into my parlor?" "Oh yes," says the giddy fly, "it looks so nice,
      positively inviting?" But what of the other rooms in your house; your
      garret near the sky, where you do star-gazing, and your basement, where
      crawl the foul things of savage superstition?
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of our readers have heard Mrs. Besant in the sweet persuasive vein,
      and felt pleased if rather muddled. For their sakes, and not for our own
      satisfaction, we shall criticise her little volume on <i>Death&mdash;and
      After?</i> just issued as No. III. of a series of Theosophical Manuals.
      When we have done they will know more about Theosophy than if they had
      listened to Mrs. Besant (especially from Freethought platforms) for ten
      thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, let us notice Mrs. Besant's attitude. Her devotion to the Blavatsky
      is complete; she mentions the great woman with profound veneration, swears
      to all she taught, and, in fact, just stews down the Blavatsky's
      voluminous nonsense. Mrs. Besant is also a patient disciple of the Masters&mdash;to
      wit, the Mahatmas. These Masters of Wisdom never appear for inspection.
      They lurk in the secret fastnesses of Tibet, which is a very unexplored
      part of the world, large enough to hide a good many things, even things
      that do not exist. They know a lot, but what dribbles out of them is very
      commonplace when it is not pompously silly. They inhabit higher planes of
      life than our greatest saints and sages, but somehow they have done
      nothing for Tibet, which is one of the poorest, dirtiest, and most
      degraded countries on earth. Still, they are going to give a tremendous
      lift to the civilisation of Europe; and if we live long enough we shall
      see what we <i>do</i> see. Mahatmas are really the distinctive feature of
      Theosophy; it is absolutely nothing without them; and, in our opinion,
      they are a most farcical swindle Madame Blavatsky created <i>these</i> out
      of her own fertile imagination, she put them where they could not be
      found, and she said, "If you want to know anything about them come to me;
      I am the chosen vehicle of their sublime revelations." And if you laughed
      at her Mahatmas, she was capable of indulging in expletives that would
      strike envy into the soul of a trooper. How curious it is, if these
      Mahatmas are real personages, that they do not communicate with <i>our</i>
      Masters of Wisdom. Why do they neglect our Spencers and Huxleys? Why do
      they choose to speak through a woman like Madame Blavatsky, or a popular
      lecturess like Mrs. Besant? Why are they so fond of the ladies? Cannot
      they have some dealings with <i>a man</i>, a man of great eminence as a
      philosopher, of high and undisputed character, and of vast influence with
      the educated and thoughtful classes? Why, in short, do the Mahatmas
      confine their attention to smaller persons <i>with fish to fry?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Relying upon these Mahatmas, and upon Madame Blavatsky, her great guide,
      philosopher, and friend, Mrs. Besant has an extremely easy task. She makes
      no attempt to prove, she simply asserts, and it seems to be a kind of
      blasphemy to ask for evidence. She dishes everything up in Hindu
      terminology, on the ground that "the English language has as yet no
      equivalents." But will it ever have them? Never, we suspect, by the
      assistance of Theosophists. The oriental lingo is part of the fascination
      to those who like to look profound on a small stock of learning. Besides,
      it imposes on the open-mouthed; and, if the Hindu terminology were
      translated into vernacular English, they would probably exclaim, "Good
      God! there's nothing in it." It is all very well for Mrs. Besant to pour
      out second-hand praise of "technical terms." We all know their value. But
      how is it we have not got them already? Because&mdash;and this is the only
      answer&mdash;because we are ignorant of the <i>things</i>. Western
      experience does not coincide with oriental dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Besant opens her little volume with the famous story of the
      conversion to Christianity of Edwin, but she tells it very loosely, and in
      fact wrongly; which is a proof that the infallibility of the Mahatmas has
      not fallen upon their disciple. She states that while Paulinus, the
      Christian missionary, was speaking to-Edwin of life, death, and
      immortality, a bird flew in through a window, circled the hall, and flew
      out again into the darkness; whereupon the Christian priest "bade the king
      see in the flight of the bird within the-hall the transitory life of man,
      and claimed for his faith that it showed the soul, in passing from the'
      hall of life, winging its way, not in the darkness of night, but in the
      sunlit radiance of a more glorious world." Now the bird did not fly into
      the hall as Paulinus was speaking, nor did he preach this sermon upon its
      movements. It was one of Edwin's suite who introduced the bird's flight as
      a metaphor, reminding the king that sometimes at supper, in the winter, a
      sparrow would fly in out of the storm, entering at one door and passing
      out at another, staying but a minute, and after that minute returning to
      winter as from winter it came. "Such is the life of man," said the Saxon
      speaker, "and of what follows it, or what has preceded it, we are
      altogether ignorant; wherefore, if this new doctrine should bring anything
      more certain, it well deserves to be followed." This is how the incident
      is related by Bede, though it is probably apocryphal; nevertheless it
      ought not to be hashed up by fresh cooks; and if the matter is in itself
      of trifling importance, it is as well to be accurate, especially when you
      pretend a close acquaintance with the Masters of Wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hundred years have elapsed since Paulinus talked with Edwin, and
      to-day, says Mrs. Besant, there are "more people in Christendom who
      question whether a man has a spirit to come anywhence or to go
      any-whither, than, perhaps, in the world's history could ever before have
      been found at one time." We are also reminded that man has always been
      asking whence the soul comes, and whither it goes, and "the answers have
      varied with the faiths." <i>This</i> is true, at any rate; but it does not
      suggest to Mrs. Besant any lesson of modesty or hesitation. Despite the
      discord of so many ages, she is most coolly dogmatic. It does not,
      apparently, occur to her to ask <i>why</i> the discord has perpetually
      prevailed. In matters of science, after investigation and discussion, the
      world comes to an agreement; in matters of theology (or, if you like,
      Theosophy) the world grows more and more at variance. <i>Why</i> is this?
      There must be an explanation. And to our mind the explanation is very
      simple. In matters of science men deal with <i>facts</i>, while in those
      other matters they deal with <i>fancies</i>, and the more freedom you give
      them the greater will be the variety of their preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Besant's new superstition of Theosophy is, in our judgment, more
      foolish and less dignified than Christianity. We are therefore moved to
      say that she does injustice to Christianity in representing it as
      responsible for all the black paraphernalia and lugubrious ceremonies of
      death. There was, indeed, nothing of all this among the primitive
      Christians. Such things belong to the world's common customs and
      superstitions. Black was not merely a sign of sorrow, or at least of
      depression; it was also thought to be protective against ghosts; so that
      these trappings and suits of woe belong to the very "spookology" which is
      an integral part of Theosophy. Of course I freely admit that the ordinary
      gloom of death has been deepened by the Christian doctrine of hell, though
      Mrs. Besant seems to think otherwise. She inclines to the belief that the
      Western fear of death is ethnological, being the antithesis of its
      vigorous life. But it may be objected that the old Romans were
      comparatively free from this terror. On the other hand, it must be allowed
      that Mrs. Besant is right in her observation that "the more mystical
      dreamy East" has little dread of the "shadow cloaked from head to foot,"
      since it is ever ever seeking to escape from "from the thraldom of the
      senses," and is apt to look upon "the disembodied state as eminently
      desirable and as most conducive to unfettered thought." In other words,
      that "when the brains are out," as Macbeth says, man's intellect undergoes
      a wonderful improvement; an opinion, by the way, which is quite in harmony
      with Theosophical teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving the Theosophical view of the "body," Mrs. Besant says that
      when once we <i>thus</i> come to regard it, death loses all its terrors.
      But this is not the sole achievement of Theosophy. What terror had death
      to Charles Bradlaugh? What terror had death to Mrs. Besant while she was
      an Atheist? There are thousands of sceptics who do not want Theosophy to
      redeem them from a terror which they have long cast behind them, with the
      superstition by which it was bred and cherished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pause to remark that Mrs. Besant quotes from <i>Paradise Lost</i>
      its magnificent description of Death. She appreciates at least the
      splendor of the diction, but she does not notice how poor in comparison
      are the words she quotes from her "Masters." How is it that Milton beats
      the Mahatmas? What objects they look when the great English poet rises
      "with his singing robes about him"! How thin their music when he strikes
      upon his thrilling lyre, or blows his rousing trumpet, or rolls from his
      mighty organ the floods of entrancing harmony!
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the main subject. It is absurd, as Mrs. Besant points
      out, to claim for Christianity that it "brought life and immortality to
      light." The belief in a future life was an intense conviction&mdash;or,
      perhaps we should say, a perfect truism&mdash;among the people of ancient
      India and Egypt. Yet here again, with her taste for dogmatic rhetoric,
      Mrs. Besant gratuitously exaggerates. "The whole ancient world," she says,
      "basked in the full sunshine of belief in the immortality of man, lived in
      it daily, voiced it in their literature, and went with it in calm serenity
      through the gate of Death." Now "calm serenity" is bad tautology, and the
      general assertion of this passage is equally open to censure. "The whole
      ancient world," as the Americans would say, is a large order. Greece and
      Rome (to say nothing of the pre-Maccabean Jews) were very important parts
      of "the whole ancient world," and whoever asserts that <i>their</i>
      citizens "basked in the sunshine of belief in immortality" is simply
      making a confession of ignorance. Greek and Roman poets and philosophers
      in many cases doubted, or even denied, a life beyond the grave. Even when
      the doctrine was entertained it does not appear to have been productive of
      much "sunshine." Does not the poet make the shade of the great Achilles
      say that he would rather be the veriest day-drudge on earth than command
      all the armies of the ghosts in the cold pale realm of the dead? We do not
      ignore, on the other hand, the Islands of the Blest; we are only objecting
      to Mrs. Besant's loose and sweeping assertions, which prove very clearly
      that her new "faith" is not remarkable in the cultivation of accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to man&mdash;the <i>entire</i> human being, mortal and
      immortal&mdash;Mrs. Besant remarks that "un-instructed Christians" chop
      him into two, the body-that perishes at death, and the "something that
      survives death." She omits to notice that a good many Christians chop him
      into three, to say nothing of others, like the Christadelphians, who leave
      him one and indivisible. Mrs. Besant, for her part, as a true
      Theo-sophist, goes farther than the sharpest Christian dissectors. She
      chops man into <i>seven</i>. When she was a Materialist she never
      suspected that her nature was so composite, and we are still in the same
      benighted condition. One begins to feel that the injunction, "Man, know
      thyself," is a terrible burden. It is hard enough to get a fair knowledge
      of our organism, its physical constitution, its intellectual faculties,
      and its moral tendencies; but the task is absolutely appalling when, we
      have to get a satisfactory knowledge of our Atma, our Buddhi, our Manas,
      our Kama, our Prana, our Linga Sharira, and our Sthula Sharira. Anyone who
      can master all that may as well go on unto seventy times seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immortal soul consists of the upper three, which are a trinity in
      everlasting unity. The heavens may wax old as a garment, but they "go on
      for ever," and flourish in immortal youth. Death is the first step in the
      process of their separation from the lower and perishable four. One after
      another of these is shed, as the serpent sloughs its skin, or the
      butterfly its chrysalis; or, to use a more familiar and pungent
      illustration, which we make a present of to Mrs. Besant, as you peel an
      onion, fold after fold, until you get to the tender core. Sthula Sharira
      goes first, and the organism becomes a corpse, which is buried, or
      cremated, or eaten by cannibals. Linga Sharira, the Astral Double, had
      been attached to it by a "delicate cord," which is our old friend "the
      thread of life"&mdash;a convenient metaphor turned into a positive
      proposition. This delicate cord is snapped, not immediately, "but some
      hours" (as many as thirty-six occasionally) after "apparent death." It is
      necessary, therefore, to be very quiet in the death-chamber, while the
      Linga Sharira is eloping. One shudders to think of what might happen, of
      the indecent haste to which Number Six might be compelled, if a corpse
      were cremated a few hours after death; the corpse, for instance, of a man
      who died from cholera or the plague.
    </p>
    <p>
      This "delicate cord" which attaches Number Seven to Number Six is
      perceptible if your eyes are constructed that way; that is, if you are a
      clairvoyant, one who is able to see beyond the real. Mrs. Besant does not
      say she has seen it herself; indeed, she is always relying on someone
      else. She refers us to Andrew Jackson Davis, the "Poughkeepsie Seer" (and
      a Spiritist, though she does not say so), who "watched this escape of the
      ethereal body" and states that "the magnetic cord did not break for some
      thirty-six hours." "Others," says Mrs. Besant, "have described, in similar
      terms, how they saw a faint violet mist rise from the dying body,
      gradually condensing into a figure which was the counterpart of the
      expiring person, and attached to that person by a glittering thread." Thus
      the attachment is "delicate," "magnetic," and "glittering." In the course
      of time, we dare say, it will be decorated with a much larger variety of
      adjectives. Meanwhile we may observe that if Mrs. Besant were to preach
      this sort of "higher wisdom" to savages she would find an attentive and
      sympathetic audience. The violet mist, the Astral Double, and the
      delicate, magnetic, glittering cord, are things that they are to some
      extent already familiar with; and if she could only get them to accept her
      terminology, and talk of Sthula Sharira and Linga Sharira, they would be
      extremely promising candidates for the Theosophical kingdom of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Besant tells us that the Linga Sharira, or Astral Double, rots away
      (disintegrates) in time. It is "the ethereal counterpart of the gross body
      of man," and takes a longer time in dropping into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes this Double is seen by persons in the house, or in the
      neighborhood... the Double may be seen or heard; when seen it shows the
      dreamy hazy consciousness alluded to, is silent, vague in its aspect, and
      unresponsive.... This astral corpse remains near the physical one, and
      they disintegrate together; clairvoyants see these astral wraiths in
      churchyards, sometimes showing likeness of the dead body, sometimes as
      violet mists or lights. Such an astral corpse has been seen by a friend of
      my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point we think it well to part company with Mrs. Besant. Who would
      have imagined, ten years ago, that the colleague of Charles Bradlaugh
      would ever descend so far into superstition as to write and talk seriously
      about churchyard spooks? What she may have to say about Theosophy after
      this can hardly be of interest to any thoroughly sane person. We therefore
      close with an expression of profound regret that an earnest, eloquent lady
      who once did such service in the cause of progress, should thus fall a
      victim to some of the most childish superstitions of the human race.

      THE POETS AND LIBERAL THEOLOGY. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * <i>The Development of Theology as Illustrated in English
     Poetry from 1780 to 1830</i>.   By Stopf ord A. Brooke.
     London: Green, Essex-street.
</pre>
    <p>
      Unitarianism has had wealth and learning on its side for several
      generations, it has also enjoyed the services of some men of singular
      ability, yet it has signally failed to make an impression upon the general
      public. In all probability it ever <i>will</i> fail. Those who like
      theology at all, for the most part like it hot and strong. To purge it of
      its "grosser" features is to rob it of its chief attraction. The ignorant
      and thoughtless multitude want plenty of supernaturalism. Those who think
      for themselves, on the other hand, are apt to grow dissatisfied with
      theology altogether, and to advance beyond the somewhat arbitrary and
      fantastic limits of the Unitarian faith. For this reason Unitarianism was
      called by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of the great Charles Darwin, a
      feather bed to catch a falling Christian. Others regard it as a halfway
      house between Christianity and Atheism, or even as a bathing machine for
      those who would wade, and fear to plunge, in the waters of Freethought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not, however, deny the distinction of such advocates of the
      Unitarian faith as Dr. Martineau and Dr. Stopf ord Brooke. The latter was
      once a clergyman of the Church of England, which he left because he no
      longer held her tenets, and in this he was more honest and courageous than
      some others who eat the Church's bread and undermine her faith. Mr. Brooke
      regards himself as a teacher of positive religion, but in our judgment his
      service to liberalism is really negative. His writings and sermons are a
      protest, however decorous, against the orthodox theology; and the protest
      may be all the more effective, with a certain order of minds, because it
      does not show them the ultimate consequences of freethinking. When they
      see the preacher aglow with the ardor of his "purified" faith in God and
      Immortality, they are encouraged to advance as far as he has gone, and
      thus to leave behind them the worst portions of the creed of their
      childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brooke is well known in the field of literature, and is held to shine
      as a critic of poetry. Hence it was that the British and Foreign Unitarian
      Association appointed him to deliver the first lecture of a course
      "dealing with some aspect of the history and development of Christianity
      as viewed from a liberal and progressive standpoint." The special subject
      selected was the development of theology as illustrated in English poetry,
      and the lecture is now published in a neat little volume for the general
      reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      We notice the frequent recurrence of the phrase "liberal theology."
      Naturally we like everybody to be liberal, but we cannot see the
      appropriateness of the epithet in this instance. It would sound strange to
      talk of "liberal geology" or "liberal chemistry." Why then should we talk
      of "liberal theology"? If theology is anything but an effort of
      imagination&mdash;as <i>we</i> conceive it&mdash;it must be a system of
      ascertained truth. Its propositions are therefore true or false, but they
      cannot be good or bad, liberal or illiberal. Introduce these epithets, and
      you make it a matter of taste and preference, or of conformity or
      non-conformity to the spirit of advancing civilisation. This is indeed
      what Mr. Brooke appears to mean. He seems to regard theology as liberal or
      otherwise as it adapts itself to the growth of knowledge and morality. He
      goes to the length of admitting that secular progress precedes religious
      progress. "The Church," he says, "has always followed society." The change
      in theology, which has made it "liberal," or produced that variety of it,
      could not have appeared "in early Christian times, nor in the middle ages;
      not as long, that is, as the imperialistic or feudal theory of humanity
      and its rulers existed." Still more decisively, if possible, he repeats
      this statement:&mdash;"There was no chance then of theology changing until
      the existing views of human society changed. If theology was to be
      enlarged, they must first be enlarged." Now this is a truth which we have
      always insisted on, and the reason of it is destructive to "liberal" and
      all other kinds of theology. We are told that God made man, but the fact
      is that man made God, and what he made he is able to keep in repair. The
      growing idea of God's "love" is not forced upon theologians by a study of
      nature, nor by a study of scripture. It is forced upon them by the
      advancing spirit of humanity. God was once a being who loved and hated,
      and all the "liberal" theologians have done is to minimise his hatred and
      maximise his love. God has not made any fresh disclosures of himself, as
      Mr. Brooke teaches; the theologians have simply brought him up to date,
      and they have done so under the compulsion of secular progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brooke's conception of the Fatherhood of God is creditable to his
      feelings. The deity he worships is one who will "effectually call to
      himself and effectually keep, at last, all his children to whose free-will
      only one thing is impossible&mdash;final division from the sovereignty of
      his love." But how far is this creditable to Mr. Brooke's intelligence? It
      is certainly inconsistent with the teaching of Christ, and Mr. Brooke
      calls himself a Christian. It is no less inconsistent with all we know of
      Nature, who is supremely indifferent to the fate of individuals. To talk
      so consumedly of God's love in this age of Darwinism, with its law of
      natural selection based on a universal struggle for existence, is to fly
      in the face of common sense. But here, alas, as in so many other cases,
      the voice of reason is drowned in the chorus of sentimentalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to democracy, which is a kind of John the Baptist to Mr.
      Brooke's form of Christianity, there can be little doubt, we think, that
      it has been chiefly indebted to science, which has in three centuries,
      since the days of Copernicus and Galileo, done more to advance the
      brotherhood of man than has been done by religion from the "first syllable
      of recorded time." Mr. Brooke does not concern himself with science,
      however; but he nearly agrees with us in the matter of chronology. A vast
      alteration in thought, due to whatever causes, had been going on for
      centuries. It was a change "from exclusiveness to universality," and it
      "took a literary and philosophical form in the eighteenth century writers
      in France, and finally emerged a giant in the French Revolution." In that
      mighty upheaval "the whole of the ideas of the old society perished for
      ever and ever," and what seems to be left of them is "but their ghosts, a
      host of pale-eyed, weary phantoms."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is true and well expressed, but it should be added that most of the
      eighteenth century writers in France, particularly those who may be called
      philosophical, were vehemently opposed to Christianity, as were most of
      the eminent actors in the Revolution. Several of them were downright
      Atheists, who would have regarded the "liberal theology" of Mr. Brooke as
      a sign of mental feebleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the Revolution sprang the vivid conception of the Brotherhood of
      Man, and it was this, Mr. Brooke says, that made possible "the conception
      of God's universal Fatherhood." In other words, a change in human ideas
      rendered necessary a change in theology. Still, we have Mr. Brooke's word
      for it, the Churches and sects were the last to move. "In England," he
      declares, "the resistance offered to these ideas by the religious bodies
      has been always steady and often rancorous." It was another class of men
      who seized upon them. These were the Poets, the "most emotional, the most
      imaginative, the most prophetic, and the most clear-sighted of men."
      Sometimes they kept the name of Christians, but more often they were
      called "heretics or infidels, blasphemers or atheists." Occasionally they
      <i>were</i> Atheists, as in the case of Shelley, though it could hardly be
      expected that Mr. Brooke would emphasise the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some pithy criticism on William Blake, who was a forceful protestor
      against the old theology, Mr. Brooke passes on to Burns and Cowper. Of the
      exquisite satire of <i>Holy Willie's Prayer</i>, despite its "irreverence
      and immorality," which are after all but matters of opinion, Mr. Brooke
      says that it "weakened the worst doctrines of Calvinism far more than ten
      thousand liberal sermons have done." Cowper weakened Calvinism too, though
      he did so unintentionally. The pathos and horror of some of his poems,
      written under the heavy shadow of this awful creed, did a great deal to
      discredit it amongst thoughtful and sensitive readers. The poet was asked
      how he felt when dying. His answer was, "I feel unutterable despair."
      These terrible words prompt Mr. Brooke to write as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are words which all the good deeds of the professors of Calvinism
      will never get over. 'He was mad,' they say; but what drove him mad? Did
      Jesus teach in order that men might become insane? for Cowper is one among
      millions whom this doctrine of God has ruined morally, intellectually, or
      physically. But they have perished, unknown, unheard. This man was a poet,
      and his words have told. His personal acceptance of the horror revealed,
      as the mockery of Burns did not, the idolatrous foulness of this doctrine
      concerning God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coleridge's one specific contribution as a poet to a wider theology, in
      the opinion of Mr. Brooke, was the closing verse of the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>&mdash;which,
      by the way, is not the closing verse, but the antepenultimate.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     He prayeth best who loveth best
     All things both great and small;
     For the dear God who loveth us
     He made and loveth all.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Brooke holds that Wordsworth did a far ampler work by his doctrine of
      immanence, which is perilously near Pantheism. Understood, however, in the
      spirit of "liberal theology," it will not only finally govern, but also
      "bring about at last the complete reconcilement of science and religion."
      But we must remind Mr. Brooke that this is sheer prophecy. It is simple
      enough to utter the counter prophecy that Wordsworth's doctrine will do
      nothing of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in relation to Byron and Shelley that Mr. Brooke really comes to the
      point of his essay. Wordsworth and Coleridge turned their backs upon the
      Revolution. They were disenchanted. They failed to see that the throes of
      birth were not the end of the progressive process. One sought refuge in
      Toryism, modified by benevolence; the other in metaphysical moonshine and
      esoteric theology. Byron, on the other hand, while not in the least
      constructive, or enamored of the more advanced ideas in religion,
      politics, and sociology, was filled with a bitter hatred and satiric
      contempt for the old order of things, with its lies, hypocrisies, and
      oppressions. He embodied what Mr. Brooke calls "the destroying element of
      the Revolution," which in him was "directed by great mental force and a
      reckless daring." Among other things, he struck at "the ancient,
      accredited doctrines of theology, and he struck savagely." Mr. Brooke is
      of opinion that the poet "brought free inquiry on theology to the surface
      of society." But we think the critic is mistaken. Free inquiry on theology
      had been going on in England for more than a century, and it culminated,
      on the popular side, in Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i>. How far Byron aided
      the movement is easy of estimation. To tell the truth, he hinted
      disbelief, and scattered doubt over his pages; but he did no more, he
      never faced any question manfully; on the problems of religion his mind
      was chaotic to the very end. It is this phenomena which leads Mr. Brooke
      to infer that Byron believed in the arbitrary, vengeful God whom he
      depicted in Cain. "He believes," Mr. Brooke says, "hates what he believes,
      stamps with fury on his belief, and yet clings to it." Such a conclusion,
      however, is one we cannot accept. Byron did <i>not</i> believe; his prose,
      and his letters, prove that conclusively. But he had not the courage to
      disbelieve and to proclaim his disbelief boldly like Shelley, who had a
      hundred times more real courage than his attitudinising friend, <i>Manfred</i>
      is terrible posing; Mr. Meredith calls it "an after dinner's indigest";
      and <i>Cain</i> is rather skimble-skamble stuff, though Mr. Brooke calls
      it "the most powerful, the most human, the most serious thing he ever
      wrote, and the most effective"&mdash;which is surely a most inept
      criticism. Byron rarely succeeded as a serious poet; when he did so it was
      only in short flights. He found the proper field for his genius in <i>Don
      Juan</i>. His province was satire, and the <i>Vision of Judgment</i> is at
      the top of English achievement in this direction, A creative imagination
      he did not possess, any more than a profound intellect; and it was the
      perception of this fact which prompted his impertinent sneers at
      Shakespeare. But he had imagination enough to give wings to his satire,
      and an inexhaustible wit which played like lightning around the objects of
      his indignation or contempt. Never did he reason like Shelley, and it is
      clear that he was afraid to; he attacked in his own way what he <i>felt</i>
      to be false and despicable, and the sword he wielded was ravishingly (or
      terribly) brilliant, though it <i>never cut deep enough</i>. One loves to
      think of him at last, however, laying down his life, as he gave his
      substance, for the freedom of Greece. With all his faults, no pious or
      cowardly fear of death ever haunted his mighty spirit. How gloriously he
      would have died on the battle-field, fighting desperately for the cause of
      the people! The last verses he ever wrote showed the troubled stream of
      his life running pure at its close. Noble and sincere in its language, it
      was a fitting farewell to the world; and although the poet did not find
      his "soldier's grave," he died none the less for the cause to which he had
      pledged his fortune and the remnant of his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shelley did also a work of destruction," says Mr. Brooke, "though in a
      very different way from Byron." We should think so indeed! The "also" is
      singularly weak in this instance, for Shelley attacked the Christian
      superstition directly, and <i>Queen Mab</i> had far more readers than <i>Cain</i>,
      the cheap, pirated editions being circulated extensively among the working
      classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He began," says Mr. Brooke, "by being an Atheist, he ended by being what
      we call an Agnostic." But is this any more than a verbal distinction? It
      appears to us that Shelley's principles are the same in <i>Prometheus
      Unbound</i> as in <i>Queen Mab</i>. The change is in their presentation;
      the passionate vehemence of youth is succeeded by the restrained power of
      manhood. It is true that Shelley sang the praises of Love&mdash;"immortal"
      Love if you choose to call it so; but Mr. Brooke has to admit that he did
      not "give it a personal life." Shelley also "thinks Immortality
      improbable," yet, Mr. Brooke says, he "glides into words in his poems
      which continually imply it." But this we deny. Allowing for
      personification and emphasis, without which there can be no poetry, we
      venture to affirm that there is not a single passage, line, or phrase in
      Shelley's later poems which is not in essential harmony with his belief in
      the mortality of man and the practical immortality of the race. It is one
      of the offences of theologians ("liberal" or otherwise) in relation to
      Shelley, that they try to turn metaphors into logical propositions, in
      order to make the poet give evidence against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, however, we quite agree with Mr. Brooke. "Liberal
      theology" has <i>not</i> yet "reached the level of Shelley's thought," nor
      can it ever do so until it ceases to be Theology and becomes simple
      Humanity. Mr. Brooke may flatter himself that he has "a higher faith than
      Shelley had," but we think he is mistaken. Substitute "blinder" for
      "higher" and the expression would be more accurate. Shelley did believe
      that Love&mdash;not alone, but co-operating with Knowledge&mdash;would
      achieve the salvation of mankind; but he resolutely refused to talk about
      man's "destiny in God the Father," which seems to afford such comfort to
      the devotees of "liberal theology." For this he deserves the gratitude of
      all scientific Humanitarians, who should protest with all their might
      against the attempt to emasculate him into a prophet, or even an advance
      agent, of some new form of Godism. "Liberal theology" should beget its own
      poet, if it can; it should not try to steal the poet of Humanity.

      CHRISTIANITY AND LABOR. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sept. 24,1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whatever else may be thought about the present coal-strike, or lock-out,
      as it might be more accurately described, it will be admitted by many
      persons who do not rail at Political Economy that the miners are following
      a sound instinct in demanding that a decent wage shall be a fixed element
      in price. To dig coal out of the earth is worth a minimum of (say) thirty
      shillings a week, and if it will not yield that modest remuneration to the
      worker let it stay where it is, and let the community do without coal
      altogether. Morally speaking, society has no right to demand that an
      important industry shall be carried on under conditions involving the
      misery, and still less the degradation, of those employed in it. Nor is
      this a wild, revolutionary doctrine; it is eminently conservative, in the
      best sense of the word; and it will have to be admitted, and acted upon,
      in the interest of social order. Of course it means an inroad on rent and
      speculative profit, but that is not an immeasurable calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much, by way of introduction, on the moral and economic aspects of the
      matter. Our special object is rather theological. We desire to notice the
      part which religion plays in the struggle between capital and labor; or,
      more properly perhaps, between the "haves" and the "have-nots."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone with an elementary knowledge of the social and political history
      of the last hundred years must be aware that the working classes, as such,
      have had no help whatever from Christian Churches. Here and there an
      individual clergyman has spoken a word on their behalf, but the great mass
      of the men of God have been on the side of "the powers that be," and have
      insulted and derided the advocates and leaders of Trade Unionism, whom
      they are still fond of calling "pestilent agitators." Yet the Gospel, and
      especially the Sermon on the Mount, is stuffed with platitudes about the
      blessings and virtues of poverty, and the curse and wickedness of wealth.
      Logically, therefore, judging by the letter of scripture, the clergy
      should have been on the side of the poor, the wretched, and the oppressed.
      But this is a case in which "the letter killeth," and with an eye to their
      own interests and privileges, to say nothing of their ease and comfort,
      the clergy found that "the spirit" of the Gospel meant the preservation of
      the existing conditions of society. It would be bad for the rich, and well
      for the poor, in the next life; but, in this life, they were to keep their
      relative places, and remain content in the positions which Providence had
      assigned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising, then, that the Christian Churches&mdash;with all
      their wealth, power, and at least pretended influence&mdash;should be idle
      or unctuously hypocritical spectators of the struggles of labor to obtain
      a fair share of the blessings of civilisation. They extend just sufficient
      verbal patronage to labor to save themselves from being howled at, and
      throw all their real weight in the scale against it. And it is folly to
      expect any better of them. The religion and the training of the clergy
      make them what they are, and they can no more alter than the Ethiopian can
      change his skin or the leopard his spots. Religion is always the
      consecration of the past; never the spirit of the future working in the
      present; and the clergy, who, as Sidney Smith said, are a third sex&mdash;neither
      male nor female, but effeminate&mdash;are instinctively conservative,
      thoroughly enamored of what is, and obstinately averse to all radical
      changes. Their timidity would be quite phenomenal, if they were <i>not</i>
      the third sex; and, like all timid people, they can shriek and yell and
      curse and foam at the mouth when they are well frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it otherwise, were Christianity a real agency for social improvement,
      and the clergy the moral leaders of the people, we should have seen by
      this time a tremendous alteration in the condition, and the relations, of
      all classes of society. There might still be differences, but they would
      be on a higher plane, and less grievous and exasperating. As the case
      stands, all the best of the clergy can do is to preach harmless platitudes
      once a week. One Bishop has been actually harangueing the miners, and only
      provoking contemptuous remarks about his salary. The truth is, that
      Christian ministers are, in the main, only fit to preach kingdom-come.
      That is their proper work, ana they are exactly cut out for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not in love with all the details of the elaborate ecclesiasticism
      of Comte's Religion of Humanity, but we are bound to say that a
      philosophical priesthood, such as he planned, would be better fitted than
      a Christian priesthood for the work of moral control and social diplomacy.
      There is an ethical as well as an economical element in most of these
      disputes between labor and capital; and a philosophical priesthood, vowed
      to study and simplicity of life, would be able to intervene with some
      effect. It would be something, indeed, to have the deliberate judgment of
      a dispassionate though sympathetic tribunal, even though it had&mdash;and
      could and should have&mdash;no authority to enforce its decisions. At
      present, however, all this is Utopian, and perhaps it always will be so.
      We will return, therefore, to our immediate object, which is to point out
      the utter uselessness of Christianity in the midst of class antagonisms.
      It cannot control the rich, it cannot assist the poor. Its chief idea is
      to stand between the two, not as an ambassador of justice, but as a
      dispenser of charity. And <i>this</i> charity, instead of really helping
      the people, only serves to obscure the problems to be solved, and to
      perpetuate the evils it affects to relieve.

    <h2>
      AN EASTER EGG FOR CHRISTIANS. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * April, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      Christian Fellow Citizens,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We are living together in this world, but I do not know whether we shall
      live together in the next world. You probably consider yourself as booked
      for heaven, and me as booked for the other establishment. But that is a
      question I will not discuss at present. I will only remark that you may be
      mistaken. Existence, you know, is full of surprises; and, as the French
      say, it is always the unexpected that happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my fellow citizens of this world, it is now the time when you
      celebrate the death and resurrection of your "Savior." Not being of your
      faith, I cannot join in the commemoration. I shall, however, regard the
      season after a more primitive fashion. Your Church adopted an old Pagan
      festival, the rejoicing at the renewal of the earth in the genial
      springtide. At the vernal equinox the sun is increasing in power, the
      world is astir with new life, and begins to reassume its mantle of green.
      Such a time inspired jollity in the human breast. It was commemorated with
      feast and dance and song. Perhaps it will be so again, even in sombre
      England, when the gloom of your ascetic creed has lifted and disappeared.
      Meanwhile I, as a "heathen man and a sinner," will imitate as far as I may
      the example of the Pagans of old. I will not sing, for I am no adept in
      that line; and my joints are getting too stiff for dancing. But I will
      feast, within the bounds of reason; I will leave this million-peopled
      Babylon and put myself in touch with Mother Nature; I will feel, if only
      for a brief while, the spring of the turf under my feet; I will breathe
      air purified by "the moving waters at their priest-like task Of pure
      ablution round earth's human shores"; I will watch the seahorses, with
      their white crests, in endless rank, charging the shore; I will listen to
      the sound which Homer heard so long before your Christ was born&mdash;the
      sound so monotonous, so melancholy, yet so soothing and sustaining, which
      stirs a pulse of poetry in the very dullest and most prosaic brain. But
      before I go I send you this Easter egg, to show that I do not forget you.
      Keep it, I pray you; study well its inscriptions; and perhaps, after all,
      you will not pelt me with it at the finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said, my Christian fellow citizens, that your Church appropriated
      an ancient Pagan festival&mdash;the festival of spring. I may be told by
      scholars amongst you that the time of Christ's crucifixion and
      resurrection was fixed by the Jewish Passover. I reply that the Passover
      was itself a spring festival, whose original and natural meaning was
      obscured by priestly arts and legendary stories. That it happened at this
      time of the year, that it depended on astronomical signs, that its
      commemoration included the sacrifice of the firstlings of the flock&mdash;shows
      clearly enough that it was a Jewish counterpart of the common Gentile
      celebration. Has it ever occurred to you that if Christ died, he died on a
      particular day; and that if he rose from the dead, he rose on a particular
      morning? That day, that morning, should have been observed in the proper
      fashion of anniversaries. But it never was, and it is not now. Good Friday&mdash;as
      you curiously, and almost facetiously call the day on which the founder of
      your faith suffered a painful and ignominious death&mdash;and Easter
      Sunday, when he left his sepulchre, never fall on the same date in
      successive years. They are determined by calculations of the position of
      the sun and the phases of the moon&mdash;a planet sacred to lovers and
      lunatics, and naturally dear therefore to devotion and superstition. You
      decorate your churches with evergreens and flowers as the Pagans decorated
      their temples and altars. You use Easter eggs like the pre-Christian
      religionists. You show, and your creed shows, in everything that Easter is
      really a spring festival. The year springs from the tomb of winter, and
      Christ springs at the same time from the tomb of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am disposed to regard your "Savior" as a purely mythical personage, like
      all other Saviors and sun-gods of antiquity, who were generally, if not
      always, born miraculously of virgin mothers, mysteriously impregnated by
      celestial visitors; and whose careers, like that of your Christ, were
      marked by portents and prodigies, ending in tribulation and defeat, which
      were followed by vindication and triumph. Whether there was a man called
      Jesus, or Joshua (the Jewish form of the name), who lived and taught in
      Galilee and died at Jerusalem, is more than I will undertake to determine,
      and it seems to me a question of microscopic importance. But I am
      convinced that the Christ of the Gospels is the product of religious
      imagination; an ideal figure, constructed out of materials that were
      common in the East for hundreds and perhaps for thousands of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confine ourselves, however, to the Easter aspect of the matter, I think
      you will find&mdash;if you read the Gospel story with unprejudiced eyes&mdash;that
      the closing scenes of Christ's career are quite imaginary. The story of
      his Trial and Crucifixion is utterly at variance with Roman law and Jewish
      custom. It also includes astonishing incidents&mdash;such as the
      earthquake which rent the veil of the temple, the three hours' eclipse of
      the sun, and the wholesale resurrection of dead "saints"&mdash;of which
      the Romans and the Jews were in a still more astonishing ignorance. What
      must have startled the whole or the then known world, if it happened, made
      absolutely no impression on the Hebrew and Gentile nations, and not a
      trace of it remains in the pages of their historians. Can you believe that
      the most remarkable occurrences on record escaped the attention of all who
      were living at the time, with the exception of a handful of men and women,
      who never took the trouble to write an account of their experiences, but
      left them to be chronicled by unknown writers long after they themselves
      were dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      All the documentary evidence we possess is Christian. It is the witness of
      an interested party, uncorroborated by a particle of testimony from
      independent sources. I do not forget that the literature of your early
      Church includes a letter from Pontius Pilate to the emperor Tiberius,
      giving a detailed account of the trial, sentence, crucifixion, and
      resurrection of Christ; but this is one of the many forgeries of your
      early Church, and is now universally rejected as such alike by Protestant
      and by Catholic scholars. To my mind, indeed, this forgery itself proves
      the falsehood of the Gospel narrative; it shows that the early Christians
      felt the necessity of some corroborative evidence, and they manufactured
      it to give their own statements an air of greater plausibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the Gospels as they stand, I will ask you to read the story in
      Matthew (not that I believe <i>he</i> wrote it) of the watch at Christ's
      sepulchre. The Jewish priests come to Pilate, and ask him to let the
      sepulchre be sealed and guarded; for the dead impostor had declared he
      would rise again on the third day, and his disciples might steal his body
      and say he had risen. The guard is set, but an angel descends from heaven,
      terrifies the soldiers, rolls away the stone, and allows Jesus to escape.
      Whereupon the Jewish priests give the soldiers money to tell Pilate that
      they slept at their posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, I ask, did those Jewish priests know that Jesus had said "After three
      days I will rise again"? According to John (xx. 9), his very disciples
      were ignorant of this fact&mdash;"For as yet they knew not the scripture,
      that he must rise again from the dead." Could it be unknown to his
      intimates, who had been with him day and night for three years, in all
      parts of Palestine; yet well known to the priests, who had only seen him
      occasionally during a few days at Jerusalem?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an "earthquake" before the angels descended. Would not this have
      attracted general attention? And is it conceivable that the soldiers would
      take money to say they had slept at their posts? The punishment for that
      offence was death. Of what use then was the bribe? Do men sell their honor
      for what they can never enjoy, and count their lives as a mere trifle in
      the bargain? Is it conceivable that the priests were so foolish as the
      story depicts them? Would bribing the soldiers protect them against
      Christ? If he had risen he was lord of life and death. Would they not have
      abandoned their projects against him, and sought his forgiveness? He who
      had the power to revive himself had the power to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearances of Jesus, after his resurrection, are grotesque in their
      self-contradiction. Now he is a pure ghost, suddenly appearing and
      suddenly vanishing, and entering a room with shut doors. Then he appears
      as solid flesh and blood, to be felt and handled. He even eats broiled
      fish and honeycomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such conditions are quite irreconcilable. We may imagine a ghost going
      through a keyhole, but is it possible to imagine broiled fish and
      honeycomb going through the same aperture? Or is the stomach of a ghost
      capable of digesting such victuals?
    </p>
    <p>
      Has it never struck you as strange, also, that the risen Christ never
      appeared to anyone but his disciples? No outsider, no independent witness,
      ever caught a glimpse of him. The story is a party report to prove a party
      position and maintain a party's interests. Surely, if Christ died for <i>all
      men</i>, if his resurrection is the pledge of ours, and if our inability
      to believe it involves our perdition, <i>the fact</i> should have been
      established beyond all cavil. Christ should have stood before Pilate who
      sentenced him to be crucified; he should have confronted the Sanhedrim who
      compassed his death; he might even have walked about freely amongst the
      Jews during the forty days (more or less) during which, as the New
      Testament narrates, he flitted about like a hedge-row ghost. He should
      have made his resurrection as clear as daylight, and he left it as dark as
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ask what became of the body of Jesus if he did not rise, is an idle
      question. There is not the slightest <i>contemporary</i> evidence that his
      body was an object of concern. On the other hand, however, the story of
      the Ascension looks like a convenient refuge. To talk of a risen Christ
      was to invite the question "Where is he?" The story of the Ascension
      enabled the talkers to answer "He is gone up." It relieved them from the
      awkward necessity of producing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space does not allow of my discussing this subject more extensively. I
      could swell this Easter egg into gigantic proportions, but I must leave it
      as it is It goes to you with my compliments, and a hope that it will do
      you good. If it leads any of you to "take a thought and mend," if it
      induces one of you to review the faith of his childhood, if it stirs a
      rational impulse in a single Christian mind, I shall be amply rewarded for
      my trouble.&mdash;Christian fellow citizens, Adieu!&mdash;I remain, Yours
      for Reason and Humanity.

    <h2>
      DUELLING. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * July 22, 1888.
</pre>
    <p>
      One result of the recent duel between M. Floquet and the melodramatic
      General Boulanger is that Bishop Freppel has moved in the Chamber of
      Deputies for the legal abolition of private combats. That a bishop should
      do this is remarkable. If Bishop Freppel possessed any sense of humor, he
      would leave the task to laymen. His Church did not establish duelling; on
      the contrary, she censured it; but it was countenanced by her principles,
      and her protest was unavailing. The judicial combat was an appeal to God,
      like the ordeal by fire or water, or the purgation by oath. The Church
      patronised those forms of superstition which brought men to her altars,
      and ministered to her profit and power, and she opposed those
      superstitions which were inimical to her interest. When legal proofs
      failed and suits were undecided; when persons were accused of crimes, of
      which they could neither be proved guilty nor held guiltless; or when they
      lay under gross suspicion of wrong, the Church proffered the ordeal. She
      invited the litigants, or the suspected parties, to handle hot iron,
      plunge their arms into boiling liquid, or be thrown into water deep enough
      to drown them; and if they underwent such treatment without injury, she
      held them innocent. Another device was the oath. The parties went to the
      Church altar and swore their innocence or the justice of their cause. But
      all these methods gave room for chicane. Kings and knights protested that
      the oath led to indiscriminate perjury, that if the priests' hands were
      tickled with money the hot iron was only painted, and that a suitable fee
      could render the boiling liquid innocuous to the skin of a baby. They
      therefore drew their swords, exclaiming, "Away with this priestly
      jugglery! These weapons are better than fire or water or oil, and God can
      decide the right in single combat as in the Churchman's ordeal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not true," asked King Gundobald of Bishop Avitus, "that the event
      of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgment of God;
      and that his providence awards the victory to the juster cause?" The
      Bishop could not answer "No," for if he did he would have demolished the
      whole Church system of ordeals, so he yielded to the arguments of his
      sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single combats, under the Gothic code, were fought according to judicial
      forms. They were held, Robertson says, "as solemn appeals to the
      omniscience and justice of the Supreme Being." Shakespeare is careful to
      to notice this feature. When Bolingbroke and Norfolk, in <i>Richard II.</i>,
      challenge each other as traitors, the king consents to their duel in the
      following terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day: There shall your swords and lances
      arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate. Since we cannot
      atone you, we shall see Justice design the victor's chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern duelling is thus a survival of the old judicial combat. The "point
      of honor" is the excuse for a practice which has lost its original
      sanction. The appeal to God is forgotten, and the duellists talk of
      "satisfaction." Illogical no doubt, but this is only one of many customs
      that survive their original meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Church cannot hold itself guiltless in regard to this folly. She
      cherished the superstition on which it rested. She taught the policy of
      appealing to God, and only frowned on the particular method which brought
      no grist to her mill. Her own methods were still more senseless. Unless
      the laws of nature were constantly subverted, her ordeals must have
      operated at random when they were not regulated by fraud. The hand of
      guilt might be harder than that of innocence, and more likely to bear a
      moment's contact with hot iron or boiling oil. Besides, as Montesquieu
      observes, the poltroon stood the poorest chance in the judicial combat,
      and the poltroon was more likely to be guilty than the man of courage. The
      weak, of course, were at the mercy of the strong; but in one point, at
      least, the combat had an obvious advantage over the other ordeals.
    </p>
    <p>
      How amusing it must have been to a sceptic, if such then existed, to see
      the opposition between the nobles and the clergy. The nobles said "Fight!"
      and the clergy cried "That is impious." The clergy said "Swear!" and the
      nobles cried "That is sacrilege and leads to perjury."
    </p>
    <p>
      No less amusing was the turn which combat took in Spain in the eleventh
      century. There was a struggle between the Latin and the Gothic liturgy.
      Aragon yielded to the papal pressure, but Castile thought the contest
      should be decided by the sword. Accordingly, Mosheim tells us, two
      champions were chosen; they fought, and the Latin liturgy was defeated.
      But the Romish party was not satisfied. The two liturgies were thrown into
      a fire, and the result of the ordeal was another triumph for the Goths.
      Still the divine decisions are frail when opposed to the interests of the
      Church. Queen Constantia, who controlled King Alphonso, sided with the
      pontiff of Rome, and the priest and the lady carried the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though incorporated in the judicial system of Christendom, the duel is
      scorned by the Turks, and was unknown to the Greeks and Romans. Lord Bacon
      remarks this in one of his admirable law tracts:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All memory doth consent that Greece and Rome were the most valiant and
      generous nations of the world; and, that which is more to be noted, they
      were free estates, and not under a monarchy; whereby a man would think it
      a great deal the more reason that particular persons should have righted
      themselves; and yet they had not this practice of duels, nor anything that
      bare show thereof." (<i>Charge against Duels.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon observes that the most valorous and generous nations scorn this
      practice. Why then did it obtain so long in Christendom? Was it because
      the Northern and Western nations were cowardly and selfish? Nothing of the
      kind; it was because they were superstitious, and their superstition was
      cherished by the Church. Even at the present day the Church calls
      international combat an appeal to God; regimental banners are consecrated
      by priests, and laid up in temples when dilapidated; and Catholic and
      Protestant priests alike implore victory for their respective sides in
      time of war. And why not? Is not the Bible God "the Lord of Hosts" and "a
      man of war"? Did he not teach David's fingers to fight? Were not Joshua
      and Jehu, the two greatest tigers in history, his chosen generals? Why
      then should he be averse to international butchery in Europe? Should he
      not rejoice in the next bloody cockpit of featherless bipeds? And is it
      not hard to see his infinite appetite for blood reduced to content itself
      with an occasional duel, in which not enough of the sanguine fluid is shed
      to make a small black-pudding? Bishop Freppel is ill-advised. He should
      not rob his Deity of his last consolation.

    <h2>
      DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * July 2, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      The ramming and sinking of the "Victoria" is the great event of the day.
      It is said to show the uselessness of big ironclads in naval warfare. But
      as the "Camperdown," which sent the "Victoria" to the bottom in a few
      minutes, has herself sustained very little damage, it looks as though
      "rams" were anything but inefficient. There has never yet been an
      engagement between two fleets of ironclads, and no one knows how they
      would behave in an actual battle. Our own impression is that both fleets
      would go to the bottom, and this opinion is shared by a good many
      practical persons at Portsmouth and Devonport. However that may be, it is
      a great pity that "civilised" nations are still so uncivilised as to spend
      their time and money on these costly engines of destruction. We are well
      aware that the newspapers go into hysterics over our soldiers and sailors,
      and no doubt many of them are very gallant fellows. But in this, we
      venture to think, they do not represent the masses of the people. Never
      have we witnessed such deep and sincere enthusiasm as was displayed by the
      crowd of spectators at the Agricultural Hall, while the American,
      Portuguese, and English firemen were going through their evolutions. The
      business of these fine fellows was to <i>save</i> life. They incurred the
      deadliest danger for human preservation, and not for human destruction.
      And how the people cheered them as they rode upon their engines, drawn by
      galloping horses! With what breathless interest they watched them climbing
      up ladders, sliding down ropes, and bearing men on their backs out of
      third-floor windows! It did one good to watch the proceedings, which
      showed that a new spirit was taking possession of the people, that they
      were beginning to be more interested in the savers than in the slayers of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this is a digression. Let us return to the "Victoria." She is now
      in eighty fathoms of water with her hundreds of dead. Poor fellows! theirs
      was a sad fate; though not more so than the fate of miners blasted or
      suffocated in explosive pits. We pity their dear ones&mdash;mothers,
      sisters, wives, and children. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hearts are
      aching on their account; mourning for the dead who will never be buried
      under the sweet churchyard grass, though they have the whole ocean for
      their tomb and the stars for its nightlamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, of course, the sky-pilots, all over England, were busy at
      "improving the occasion." They always make profit out of death and
      disaster. "Prepare to meet thy God!" was the lesson which most of them
      derived from this catastrophe. Of course the preachers are ready <i>themselves</i>.
      Who can doubt it? But they are in no hurry to have it tested. They do not
      want to meet their God until they are obliged to. It is so much better to
      be a commercial traveller in God's service than to take a situation in the
      house.

      Some of the preachers dared to talk about "Providence"&mdash;the sweet
      little cherub that sits up aloft, to keep watch o'er the life of poor
      Jack, and lets him go to the bottom or furnish a dinner for sharks. Surely
      that Providence is a rare old fraud. A cripple, a paralytic, a sleeper, a
      dead man, could have done as much for the "Victoria" as Providence managed
      to do. "Oh!" it is said, "but the drowned sailors are gone to Heaven;
      Providence looked after them in that way." Indeed! Then why do you lament
      over them? Still more, why do you congratulate the survivors? According to
      your theory, they have missed a slice of good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have frequently remarked, and we now repeat, that religion is based
      upon the bed-rock of <i>selfishness</i>; and nothing proves the truth of
      this so clearly, and so convincingly, as the talk that people indulge in
      about Providence. For instance, take this telegram, which is printed in
      the newspapers as having been sent home to a gentleman in England:&mdash;"Jack
      saved. Awful affair. Thank God!" This telegram was written hastily, but it
      was sincere; the writer had no time to drop into hypocrisy. "Jack saved"
      was his first thought; that is, Jack is still on earth and out of heaven.
      "Awful affair" was his second thought; that is, a lot of other poor devils
      are gone to heaven&mdash;anyhow, they are no longer on earth. "Thank God"
      was his third thought; that is, Jack's all right. Thus it was two for our
      Jack, and one for all the hundreds who perished! It may be pointed out,
      too, that "Thank God!" comes in the wrong place; where it stands it seems
      to thank God for the calamity. Yes, so it does, if we look at the mere
      composition; but the order of the ejaculations is all right, if we look at
      the sentiment, the pious sentiment, of the person who wrote the telegram.
      He followed the logic of his personal feelings, like everyone else who
      "thanks God" and talks of Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Season and personal feeling often do not coincide. In this case, for
      instance, it requires a very slight exercise of the intellect to see that,
      if Providence saved "Jack," Providence drowned the rest. "No," some will
      reply, "Providence did not drown them, but only let them drown." Well,
      that is exactly the same thing. Superficially, it is the same thing; for
      Providence, like men, is responsible for omissions as well as commissions.
      If you let a blind man walk over a precipice without warning him, you are
      his murderer, you are guilty of his blood. Resolving not to do a thing is
      as much an act of will as resolving to do it. "Thou shalt" is a law as
      imperative as "Thou shalt not," though it does not figure in the
      decalogue. Profoundly also, as well as superficially, Providence, if it
      saved Jack, killed those who perished; for, as Jack was not visibly fished
      out of the water by Providence, it can only be held that Providence saved
      him on the ground that Providence <i>does everything</i>, which covers the
      whole of our contention. "I the Lord do all these things." So says the
      Bible, and so you must believe, if you have a God at all.

      SMIRCHING A HERO.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "He who fights with priests may make up his mind to have
     his poor good name torn and befouled by the most infamous
     lies and the most cutting slanders."&mdash;Heine.
</pre>
    <p>
      The great poet and wit, Heinrich Heine, from whom we select a motto for
      this article, was not very partial to Englishmen, and still less partial
      to Scotchmen. He had no objection to their human nature, but a strong
      objection to their religion, which so resembles that of the chosen people&mdash;being,
      indeed, chiefly modelled on the Old Testament pattern&mdash;that he was
      led to describe them as modern Jews, who only differed from the ancient
      ones in eating pork. Doubtless a great improvement has taken place since
      Heine penned that pungent description, but Scotland is still the home of
      orthodoxy, and most inaccessible to Liberal ideas, unless they wear a
      political garb. It need not astonish us, therefore, that a bitter attack
      on a Freethought martyr like Giordano Bruno should emanate from the land
      of John Knox; or that it should appear in the distinctly national magazine
      which is called the <i>Scottish Review</i>. The writer does not disclose
      his name, and this is a characteristic circumstance. He indulges his
      malevolence, and airs his ignorance, under a veil of anonymity. His stabs
      are delivered like those of a bravo, who hides his face as he deals his
      treacherous blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many books and articles have been written on Giordano Bruno, but this
      writer seems ignorant of them all, except a recent volume by a Romish
      priest of the Society of Jesus, which he places at the top of his article,
      and relies upon throughout as an infallible authority. It does not occur
      to him that an account of Bruno by a Jesuit member of the Church which
      murdered him, is hardly likely to be impartial; nor does he scent anything
      suspicious in the fact that the documents reporting Bruno's trial were all
      written by the Inquisition. He would probably sniff at a report of the
      trial of Jesus Christ by the Scribes and Pharisees, yet that is precisely
      the kind of document on which he relies to blast the memory of Bruno.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those Inquisition records he translates, apparently fancying he is
      making a revelation, though? they have long been before the scholarly
      public, and were extensively cited in the English <i>Life of Bruno</i>, by
      I. Frith, which saw the light more than twelve months ago. Berti reprinted
      the documents of Bruno's trial in Venice in 1880, so that the startling
      revelations of Father Previti are at least seven years behind the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dealing, however, with the use he would make of those documents, we
      think it best to track this Scotch slanderer throughout his slimy course,
      and expose his astounding mixture of ignorance, impudence and meanness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take two instances of the last "virtue" first. He actually
      condescends to attempt a feeble point in regard to Bruno's name. Bruno, he
      sagely observes&mdash;with an air of originality only intelligible on the
      ground that he is conscious of writing for the veriest ignoramuses&mdash;is
      the same as <i>Brown</i>; and hence, if we take the baptismal name of
      Filippo Bruno, it simply means Philip Brown. Well, what of that? What's in
      a name? One great English poet rejoiced in the vulgar name of Jonson; two
      other English poets bore the no less vulgar name of Thomson; while at
      least two have descended so low as Smith. We might even remind the
      orthodox libeller that Joshua, the Jewish formi of Jesus, was as common as
      Jack is among ourselves. Perhaps the reminder will sound blasphemous in
      his delicate ears, but fact is fact, and if reputations are to depend on
      names, we may as well be impartial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for our second instance. Bruno was betrayed to the Venetian
      Inquisition by Count Mocenigo while he was that nobleman's guest. Mocenigo
      had invited him to Venice in order that he might learn what this writer
      calls "his peculiar system for developing and strengthening the memory,"
      although this "peculiar" system was simply the Lullian method. What the
      nobleman really wanted to learn seems to have been the Black Art. He
      complained, and Bruno resolved to leave him; whereupon the "nobleman," who
      had harbored Bruno for months, forcibly detained him, and denounced him to
      the Inquisition as a heretic and a blasphemer. A more dastardly action is
      difficult to conceive, but our Scotch libeller is ready to defend it, or
      at least to give it a coat of whitewash. He allows that Mocenigo does not
      appear to have been animated "with the motive of religious zeal," and that
      his "conscience" never "troubled him" before the "personal difference."
      But he discovers a plea for this Judas in his "sworn statement" to the
      Inquisition that he did not suspect Bruno of being a monk until the very
      day of their quarrel. What miserable sophistry! Would not a man who
      violated the most sacred laws of friendship and hospitality be quite
      capable of telling a lie? Still more miserable is the remark that Bruno
      was not ultimately tried on Mocenigo's denunciations, but on his own
      published writings. Jesus Christ was not tried on the denunciations of
      Judas Iscariot, but on his own public utterances, yet whoever pleaded that
      this gave a sweeter savor to the traitor's kiss?
    </p>
    <p>
      So much&mdash;though more might be said&mdash;for the writer's meanness.
      Now for his other virtues, and especially his ignorance. After dwelling on
      the battle at Rome over the proposal to erect a public monument to Bruno,
      this writer tells us that "a small literature is arising on the subject,"
      and that the name of Bruno is "suddenly invested with an importance which
      it never formerly possessed." Apparently he is unaware that, so far from a
      small literature arising, a large Bruno literature has long existed. He
      has only to turn to the end of Frith's book, and he will find an
      alphabetical list of books, articles, and criticisms on Bruno, filling no
      less than ten pages of small type. He might also enlighten his ridiculous
      darkness by reading the fine chapter in Lewes's <i>History of Philosophy</i>,
      Mr. Swinburne's two noble sonnets, and Professor Tyndall's glowing eulogy
      of Bruno's scientific prescience in the famous Belfast address. Perhaps
      Hallam, Schwegler, Hegel, Bunsen and Cousin are too recondite for the
      Scotch libeller's perusal; but he might, at any rate, look up Lewes,
      Swinburne and Tyndall, who are probably accessible in his local Free
      Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth, too, does he mean by Bruno's "great obscurity" when he
      returned to Italy and fell into the jaws of the Inquisition? Every scholar
      in that age was more or less obscure, for the multitude was illiterate,
      and sovereigns and soldiers monopolised the public attention. But as
      notoriety then went, Bruno was a famous figure. Proof of this will be
      given presently. Meanwhile we may notice the cheap sneer at Bruno as "a
      social and literary failure." Shelley was a literary failure in his
      lifetime, but he is hardly so now; and if Bruno was poor and
      unappreciated, Time has adjusted the balance, for after the lapse of three
      centuries he is loved and hated by the rival parties of progress and
      reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us disprove the Scotch libeller's statements as to "the extreme
      obscurity in which Giordano Bruno lived and died." Bruno was so "obscure"
      that he fled from Naples, and doffed his priest's raiment, at the age of
      twenty-eight or twenty-nine, because his superiors were proceeding against
      him for heresy, through an act of accusation which comprised no less than
      one hundred and thirty counts. He was so "obscure" that the rest of his
      life was a prolonged flight from persecution. He was so "obscure" that the
      Calvinists hunted him out of Geneva, whence he narrowly escaped with his
      life; the documents relating to the proceedings against him being still
      preserved in the Genevan archives. He was so "obscure" that he took a
      professorship at Toulouse, and publicly lectured there to large audiences
      for more than a year. He was so "obscure" that King Henry III. made him
      professor extraordinary at Paris, and excused him from attending Mass. He
      was so "obscure" that the learned doctors of the Sorbonne waxed wroth with
      him, and made it obvious that his continued stay in Paris would be
      dangerous to his health. He was so "obscure" that he lived for nearly
      three years as the guest of the French ambassador in London. He was so
      "obscure" that he was known at the court of Elizabeth. He was so "obscure"
      that he was a friend of Sir Philip Sidney, and an intimate associate of
      Dyer, Fulk Greville, and the chief wits of his age. He was so "obscure"
      that he was allowed, as a distinguished foreigner, to lecture at Oxford,
      and to hold a public disputation on the Aristotelian philosophy before the
      Chancellor and the university. He was so "obscure" that on his return to
      Paris he held another public disputation under the auspices of the King.
      He was so "obscure" that his orations were listened to by the senate of
      the university of Wittenberg. He was so "obscure" that he was publicly
      excommunicated by the zealot Boethius. He was so "obscure" that the
      Venetian Inquisition broke through its stern rule, and handed him over as
      a special favor to the Inquisition of Rome. He was so "obscure" that he
      was at last "butchered to make a Roman holiday," the cardinals having
      presided at his trial, and his sentence being several pages at length.
      Such was "the obscurity in which Giordano Bruno lived and died."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch libeller hints that Bruno was not burnt after all. He forgets,
      or he is ignorant of the fact, that all doubt on that point is removed by
      the three papers discovered in the Vatican Library. He merely repeats the
      insinuation of M. Desduits, which has lost its extremely small measure of
      plausibility since the discovery of those documents. The martyrdom of
      Bruno is much better attested than the Crucifixion. There always was
      contemporary evidence as well as unbroken tradition, and now we have
      proofs as complete as can be adduced for any event in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the documentary evidence it is clear that Bruno fought hard for his
      life, and he would have been a fool or a suicide to have acted otherwise.
      He bent all his dialectical skill, and all his subtle intellect, to the
      task of proving that religion and philosophy were distinct, and that so
      long as a scholar conformed in practice he should be allowed the fullest
      liberty of speculation. The Inquisition, however, pretends that he abjured
      all his errors, and the Scotch libeller is pleased to say he recanted.
      But, in that case, why was Bruno burnt alive at the stake? According to
      the laws of the Inquisition, all who reconciled themselves to the Church
      after sentence were strangled before they were burnt. And why was Bruno
      allowed a week's grace before his execution, except to give him the
      opportunity of recanting? Despite all this Jesuitical special pleading,
      the fact remains that Bruno was sentenced and burnt as an incorrigible
      heretic; and the fact also remains that when the crucifix was held up for
      him to kiss as he stood amidst the flames, he rejected it, as Scioppus
      wrote, "with a terrible menacing countenance." Not only did he hurl scorn
      at his judges, telling them that they passed his sentence with more fear
      than he heard it; but his last words were that "he died a martyr and
      willingly"&mdash;<i>diceva che moriva martire et volontieri</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruno is further charged by the Scotch libeller with servility, an
      accusation about as plausible as that Jesus Christ was a highwayman. A
      passage is cited from Bruno's high-flown panegyric on Henry III. as "a
      specimen of the language he was prepared to employ towards the great when
      there was anything to be got from them." Either this writer is ineffably
      ignorant, or his impudence is astounding. In the first place, that was an
      age of high-flown dedications. Look at Bacon's fulsome dedication of his
      <i>Advancement of Learning</i> to James I. Nay, look at the dedication of
      our English Bible to the same monarch, who is put very little below God
      Almighty, and compared to the sun for strength and glory. In the next
      place, Bruno's praise of Henry III. was far from mercenary. He never at
      any time had more than bread to eat. He was grateful to the King for
      protection, and his gratitude never abated. When Henry was in ill repute,
      Bruno still praised him, and these panegyrics were put into one of the
      counts against "the heretic" when he was arraigned at Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last libel is extorted from Bruno's comedy, <i>Il Candelajo</i>. The
      Scotch puritan actually scents something obscene in the very title; to
      which we can only reply by parodying Carlyle&mdash;"The nose smells what
      it brings." As for the comedy itself, it must be judged by the standard of
      its age. Books were then all written for men, and reticence was unknown.
      Yet, free as <i>Il Candelajo</i> is sometimes in its portrayal of
      contemporary manners, it does not approach scores of works which are found
      "in every gentleman's library." It certainly is not freer than
      Shakespeare; it is less free than the Song of Solomon; it is infinitely
      less free than Ezekiel. Nor was the comedy the work of Bruno's maturity;
      it was written in his youth, while he was a priest, before he fell under
      grave suspicion of heresy, and we may be sure it was relished by his
      brother priests in the Dominican monastery. To draw from this youthful <i>jeu
      d'e'sprit</i>, a theory of Bruno's attitude towards women is a grotesque
      absurdity. We have his fine sonnets written in England, especially the one
      "Inscribed to the most Virtuous and Delightful Ladies," in which he
      celebrates the beauty, sweetness, and chastity of our English "spouses and
      daughters of angelic birth." Still more striking is the eulogy in his
      "Canticle of the Shining Ones." Bruno, like every poet, was susceptible to
      love; but he was doomed to wander, and the affection of wife and babes was
      not for him. So he made Philosophy his mistress, and his devotion led him
      to the stake. Surely there was a prescience of his fate in the fine
      apostrophe of his <i>Heroic Rapture</i>&mdash;"O worthy love of the
      beautiful! O desire for the divine! lend me thy wings; bring me to the
      dayspring, to the clearness of the young morning; and the outrage of the
      rabble, the storms of Time, the slings and arrows of Fortune, shall fall
      upon this tender body and shall weld it to steel."

    <h2>
      KIT MARLOWE AND JESUS CHRIST. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * December, 1888.
</pre>
    <p>
      Christopher Marlowe, whose "mighty line" was celebrated by Ben Jonson, is
      one of the glories of English literature. He was the morning star of our
      drama, which gives us the highest place in modern poetry. He definitively
      made our blank verse, which it only remained for Shakespeare to improve
      with his infinite variety; and although his daring, passionate genius was
      extinguished at the early age of twenty-nine, it has reverent admirers
      among the best and greatest critics of English literature. Many meaner
      luminaries have had their monuments while Marlowe's claims have been
      neglected; but there is now a project on foot to erect something in honor
      of his memory, and the committee includes the names of Robert Browning and
      Algernon Swinburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project evokes a howl from an anonymous Christian in the columns of
      the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. He protests against the "grotesque indecency
      of such a scheme," and stigmatises Marlowe as "a disreputable scamp, who
      lived a scandalous life and died a disgraceful death." That Marlowe was "a
      scamp" we have on the authority of those who denounced his scepticism and
      held him up as a frightful warning. His fellow poets, like Chapman and
      Drayton, spoke of him with esteem. An anonymous eulogist called him "kynde
      Kit Marlowe"; and Edward Blunt, his friend and publisher, said "the
      impression of the man hath been dear unto us, living an after-life in our
      memory." Assuredly Shakespeare's "dead shepherd" was no scamp. He
      apparently sowed his wild oats, like hundreds of other young men who were
      afterwards lauded by the orthodox. He was fond of a glass of wine in an
      age when tea and coffee were unknown, and English ladies drank beer for
      breakfast. And if he perished in a sudden brawl, it was at a time when
      everyone wore arms, and swords and daggers were readily drawn in the
      commonest quarrels. Nor should it be forgotten that he belonged to a
      "vagabond" class, half-outlawed and denounced by the clergy; that the
      drama was only then in its infancy; that it was difficult to earn bread by
      writing even immortal plays; and that irregularity of life was natural in
      a career whose penury was only diversified by haphazard successes. After
      all is said, Marlowe was no man's enemy but his own; and it is simply
      preposterous to judge him by the social customs of a more fastidious and,
      let us add, a more hypocritical age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Christian protestor is shocked at the suggestion that the Marlowe
      memorial should be placed in Westminster Abbey, "an edifice which I
      believe was originally built to the honor of Jesus Christ." "The
      blasphemies of Voltaire," he says, "pale into insignificance when compared
      with those of Marlowe;" he "deliberately accused Jesus Christ and his
      personal followers of crimes which are justly considered unmentionable in
      any civilised community," and "any monument which may be erected in honor
      of Christopher Marlowe will be a deliberate insult to Christ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now those "blasphemies" are set forth in the accusation of an informer,
      one Richard Bame, who was hanged at Tyburn the next year for some mortal
      offence. Marlowe's death prevented his arrest, and it is somewhat
      extravagant&mdash;not to give it a harsher epithet&mdash;to write as
      though the accusation had been substantiated in a legal court. One of
      Bame's statements about Marlowe's itch for coining is, upon the face of
      it, absurd, and the whole document is open to the gravest suspicion. It is
      highly probable however, that Marlowe, who was a notorious Freethinker,
      was not very guarded in his private conversation; and we have no doubt
      that in familiar intercourse, which a mercenary or malicious eavesdropper
      might overhear, he indulged in what Christians regard as "blasphemy." Like
      nine out of ten unbelievers, he very likely gave vent to pleasantries on
      the subject of Christian dogmas. There is nothing incredible in his having
      said that "Moses was but a juggler," that "the New Testament is filthily
      written" (Mr. Swinburne calls it "canine Greek"), or that "all Protestants
      are hypocritical asses." But whether he really did say that the women of
      Samaria were no better than they should be, that Jesus's leaning on John's
      bosom at the last supper was a questionable action, that Mary's honor was
      doubtful and Jesus an illegitimate child&mdash;cannot be decided before
      the Day of Judgment; though, in any case, we fail to see that such things
      make "the blasphemies of Voltaire pale into insignificance."
    </p>
    <p>
      We candidly admit, however, that a memorial to Marlowe would be
      incongruous in Westminster Abbey if Darwin were not buried there; but
      after admitting the high-priest of Evolution it seems paltry to shriek at
      the admission of other unbelievers. It will not do to blink the fact of
      Marlowe's Atheism, as is done by the two gentlemen who took up the cudgels
      on his behalf in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. Setting aside the
      accusation of that precious informer, there is other evidence of Marlowe's
      heresy. Greene reproached him for his scepticism, and every editor has
      remarked that his plays are heathenish in spirit. Lamb not only calls
      attention to the fact that "Marlowe is said to have been tainted with
      Atheistical positions," but remarks that "Barabas the Jew, and Faustus the
      Conjurer, are offsprings of a mind which at least delighted to dally with
      interdicted subjects. They both talk a language which a believer would
      have been tender of putting into the mouth of a character though but in
      fiction." Dyce could not "resist the conviction" that Marlowe's impiety
      was "confirmed and daring." His extreme Freethought is also noticed by Mr.
      Bullen and Mr. Havelock Ellis. There is, indeed, no room for a rational
      doubt on this point. Marlowe was an Atheist. But a sincere Christian, like
      Robert Browning, is nevertheless ready to honor Marlowe's genius; quite as
      ready, in fact, as Algernon Swinburne, whose impiety is no less "confirmed
      and daring" than Marlowe's own. There is freemasonry among poets; their
      opinions may differ, but they are all "sealed of the tribe." And surely we
      may all admire genius as a natural and priceless distinction, apart from
      all considerations of system and creed. What Atheist fails to reverence
      the greatness of Milton? And why should not a Christian reverence the
      greatness of Marlowe? If creed stands in the way, the Christian may keep
      his Dante and his Milton, his Cowper and his Wordsworth; but he loses
      Shakespeare, Byron, and Shelley; he loses Goethe and Victor Hugo; nay, he
      loses Homer, AEschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, and
      all the splendid poets of Persia whose lyres have sounded under the
      Mohammedan Crescent. The distinctively Christian poets, as the world goes,
      are in a very decided minority; and it is a piece of grotesque impudence
      to ban Christopher Marlowe because he declined to echo the conventional
      praises of Jesus Christ.

      JEHOVAH THE RIPPER. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * November, 1888.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Whitechapel monster has once more startled and horrified London, and
      again he has left absolutely no clue to his identity. He is the mystery of
      mysteries. He comes and goes like a ghost. Murder marks his appearance,
      but that is all we know of him. The rest is silence. The police, the
      vigilance societies, and the private detectives are all baffled. They can
      only stare at each other in blind dismay, as helpless as the poor victims
      of the fiend's performances. All sorts of theories are started, but they
      are all in the air&mdash;the wild conjectures of irresponsible
      imaginations. All sorts of stories are afloat, but they contradict each
      other. As for descriptions of the monster, it is easy enough to say that
      the police have advertised for nine or ten "wanted" gentlemen, of various
      heights, dimensions, colors, and costumes, who are all the very same
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no desire to dabble in murder, nor do we aspire to turn an honest
      penny by the minute description of bodily mutilations. But while the
      Whitechapel atrocities are engaging the public attention, we are tempted
      to contribute our quota of speculation as to the monster's identity. We
      thought of doing so before, but we reflected that it was perfectly useless
      while such a pig-headed person as Sir Charles Warren was at the head of
      the police. Now, however, that he is gone, and there is a chance of
      common-sense suggestions being fairly considered, we venture to propound
      our theory, in the hope that it will at least be treated on its merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well now, to the point. Our theory is that the Whitechapel murderer is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      "Whom?" the reader cries. Wait awhile. Brace up your nerves for the dread
      intelligence. The East-end fiend, the Whitechapel devil, the slaughterer
      and mutilator of women, is&mdash;Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blasphemous!" is shouted from a million throats. But science is used to
      such shriekings. We pause till the noise subsides, and then proceed to
      point out that our theory fulfils the grand condition of fitting in with
      all the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Whitechapel murderer is shrouded in mystery. So is Jehovah. The
      Whitechapel murderer comes no one knows whence and goes no one knows
      whither. So does Jehovah. The Whitechapel murderer appears in different
      disguises. So does Jehovah. The Whitechapel murderer's movements baffle
      all vigilance. So do Jehovah's. The Whitechapel murderer comes and goes,
      appears and disappears, with the celerity and noiselessness of a ghost. So
      does Jehovah, who <i>is</i> a ghost. Thus far, then, the similarity is
      marvellously close, and a <i>prima facie</i> case of identity is
      established.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will very likely be objected that Jehovah is incapable of such
      atrocities. But this is the misconception of ignorance or the politeness
      of hypocrisy. Jehovah has written his autobiography, and on his own
      confession his murderous exploits were very similar to those of the
      Whitechapel terror. Appealing to that incontrovertible authority, we
      propose to show that he has every disposition to commit these enormities.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to his own history of himself, Jehovah is passionately fond of
      bloodshed. The sanguine fluid which courses in our veins is the only thing
      that appeases him. "Without shedding of blood," he tells us through the
      pen of St. Paul, "there is no remission" of any debts owing to him. He
      called on Abraham, his friend, to stick a knife into his own son. He slew
      the first-born of every family in Egypt in a single night. He accepted the
      blood of a young virgin offered him by Jephthah. He slew 50,070 men at
      Beth-Shemesh for looking into his private trunk. He ordered his "chosen"
      friends, a famous set of banditti, to exterminate, men, women, children,
      and even animals, and to "leave alive nothing that breatheth." He
      massacred 70,000 citizens of Palestine because their king took a census, a
      social experiment to which he has a rooted antipathy. He had a house
      especially built for him, and gave orders that it should daily be drenched
      with blood. According to one of his candid friends, Archdeacon Farrar,
      "the floor must literally have swum with blood, and under the blaze of
      Eastern sunlight, the burning of fat and flesh on the large blazing altar
      must have been carried on amid heaps of sacrificial foulness&mdash;offal
      and skins and thick smoke and steaming putrescence." On one occasion, when
      in a state of murderous frenzy, he cried out, "I will make mine arrows
      drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehovah's passion for bloodshed is proved out of his own mouth. Let us now
      see his love of mutilation. He generally did this by proxy, and enjoyed
      the spectacle without undergoing the trouble. Some of his friends took a
      gentleman named Adoni-bezek, and "cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
      Wishing to kill a certain Eglon, the king of Moab, he sent an adventurer
      called Ehud with "a present from Jehovah." The present turned out to be an
      eighteen-inch knife, which Ehud thrust into Eglon's belly; a part of the
      body on which the Whitechapel murderer is fond of experimenting. Jehovah's
      friend David, a man after his own heart, mutilated no less than four
      hundred men, and gave their foreskins to his wife as a dowry. Incurring
      Jehovah's displeasure and wishing to conciliate him, he attacked certain
      cities, captured their inhabitants, and cut them in pieces with saws,
      axes, and harrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehovah is particularly savage towards females. He cursed a woman for
      eating an apple, and instead of killing her on the spot, he determined to
      torture her every time she became a mother. A friend of his&mdash;and we
      judge people by their friends&mdash;cut a woman up into twelve pieces, and
      sent them to various addresses by parcels' delivery. Another of his
      friends, called Menahem, made a raid on a certain territory, and "all the
      women therein that were with child he <i>ripped up</i>." Jehovah himself,
      being angry with the people of Samaria, promised to slay them with the
      sword, dash their infants to pieces, and <i>rip up</i> their pregnant
      women. No doubt he fulfilled his promise, and he would scarcely have made
      it if he had not been accustomed to such atrocities. It appears to us,
      therefore, that he is fully entitled to the name of Jehovah the Ripper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not exhausted our evidence. Far more could be adduced, but we hope
      this will suffice. It may, of course, be objected that Jehovah has
      reformed, that he is too old for midnight adventures, that he has lost his
      savage cunning, and that his son keeps a sharp eye on the aged assassin.
      But the ruling passion is never really conquered; it is even, as the
      proverb says, strong in death. We venture, therefore, to suggest that the
      Whitechapel murderer is Jehovah; and although keen eyes may detect a few
      superficial flaws in our theory&mdash;for what theory is perfect till it
      is demonstrated?&mdash;we protest that it marvellously covers the facts of
      the case, and is infinitely superior to any other theory that has hitherto
      been broached.

    <h2>
      THE PARSONS' LIVING WAGE. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * December, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      In our last week's article we criticised the attitude of the Churches
      towards the working classes, with especial reference to the late
      Conference of "representatives of Christian Churches" in the Jerusalem
      Chamber. It will be remembered that the Conference was a ridiculous
      fiasco. The upshot of it was simply and absolutely nothing. The Christian
      gentlemen there assembled could not bring themselves to pass a resolution
      in favor of "a living wage" for the workers. Mr. Hugh Price Hughes, in
      particular, asserted that no one could define it, and the discussion was
      therefore a waste of time. But suppose the question had been one of "a
      living wage" for the sky-pilots; would not a minimum figure have been
      speedily decided? Thirty shillings a week would have been laughed at. Two
      pounds would have been treated as an absurdity. Men of God, who have to
      live while they cultivate the Lord's vineyard, want a more substantial
      share of the good things of this world. Nothing satisfies them but the
      certainty of something very valuable in this life, as well as the promise
      of the life that is to come. No doubt is entertained in the clerical mind
      as to the laborer being worthy of his hire. But they give their first
      attention to the clerical laborer; partly because they know him most
      intimately, and have a deep concern for his secular welfare; and partly
      because charity begins at home and looking after one's self is the primary
      law of Christian prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burning and a shining light among the Nonconformists of the last
      generation was the famous Mr. Binney, a shrewd preacher who published a
      book on How to Make the Best of Both Worlds. We believe he combined
      precept and practice. At any rate, he expounded a principle which has
      always had the devotion of the great bulk of Christian ministers. These
      gentry <i>have</i> made the best of both worlds. Most of them have been
      comfortably assured of good positions in Kingdom-Come, and most of them
      have been comfortably provided for in this land of pilgrimage, this scene
      of tribulation, this miserable vale of tears. Come rain or shine, they
      have had little cause for complaint. Hard work has rarely brought them to
      a premature old age. Famine has never driven them into untimely graves.
      Even the worst paid has had a hope of better thing-. There were fine plums
      in the profession, which might drop into watering mouths. What if the
      curate had little pocket money and a small account at the tailor's, with a
      large account at the shoemaker's through excessive peregrinations on
      shanks's mare? There was a vicarage, a deanery, a bishopric in
      perspective. A fat purse might be dandled some day, and the well-exercised
      limbs repose gracefully in a carriage and pair. If the worst came to the
      worst, one might marry a patron's daughter, and get the reversion of the
      living; or even snap up the ninth daughter of a bishop, and make sure of
      some preferment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the clericals, taking them altogether, have had a very good "living
      wage." After all these centuries, it is high time they began to think
      about the comfort of other classes of the community. And yet, after all,
      is there not something indecent in their talking about a "living wage" for
      the workers? Are they not parasites upon the said workers? Have they not,
      also, had ever so many centuries of dominance? Is it not disgraceful that,
      at this time of day, there should be any need to discuss a "living wage"
      for the workers in a <i>Christian</i> civilisation? Really, the clericals
      should not, in this reckless way, invite attention to their past sins and
      present shortcomings. If they stand up for the workers now, it shows that
      they have not stood up for the workers before. They have been so many
      hundreds of years thinking about it&mdash;or rather <i>not</i> thinking
      about it. It is <i>interest</i>&mdash;nothing but <i>interest</i>&mdash;which
      informs their new policy. They always find out what <i>pays</i>. Never did
      they fight a forlorn hope or die for a lost cause. As the shadow follows
      the sun, so priests follow the sun of prosperity. They are the friends of
      power, whoever wields it: of wealth, whoever owns it. When they talk about
      the rights of the people, it means that they feel the king-times are
      ending. Byron said they <i>would</i> end, nearly a hundred years ago.
      Blood would flow like water, he said, and tears would fall like rain, but
      the people would triumph in the end. Yes, and the end is near; the people
      <i>are</i> triumphing; and the fact is visible to the very owls and bats
      of theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to the "living wage" business. There were several
      Bishops at the Jerusalem Chamber meeting, and in view of their incomes
      their patronage of the working man is simply disgusting. Pah! An ounce of
      civet, good apothecary! The bishops smell to heaven. Whatever they say is
      an insult to the miners&mdash;because they say it. The "living wage" of
      the poorest bishop would keep fifty miners' families; that of the richest
      would keep two hundred. "Nay," the bishops say, "we are poorer than you
      think." Only the other day, the Archbishop of Canterbury stated that most
      of the bishops spent more than they received. Indeed! Then the age of
      miracles is <i>not</i> past. By what superhuman power do they make up the
      deficiency? We tell the Archbishop that <i>he lies</i>. It is not a polite
      answer, we admit, but it is a true one; and this is a case where good
      plain Saxon is most appropriate. Edward White Benson forgets that bishops
      die. Their wills are proved like the wills of other mortals, and the
      Probate Office keeps the record. Of course it is barely possible&mdash;that
      is, it is conceivable&mdash;that bishops' executors make false returns,
      and pay probate duty on fanciful estates; but the probability is that they
      do nothing of the kind. Now some years ago (in 1886) the Rev. Mercer
      Davies, formerly chaplain of Westminster Hospital, issued a pamphlet
      entitled <i>The Bishops and their Wealth</i>, in which he gave a table of
      the English and Welsh prelates deceased from 1856 to 1885, with the amount
      of personalty proved at their death. Of one bishop he could find no
      particulars. It was Samuel Hinds, of Norwich, who resigned as a
      disbeliever, and died poor. The thirty-nine others left behind them
      collectively the sum of £2,105,000; this being "exclusive of any real
      estate they may have possessed, and exclusive also of any sums invested in
      policies of Life Assurance, or otherwise settled for the benefit of their
      families." Divide the amount of their <i>mere personalty</i> by
      thirty-nine, and you have £54,000 apiece. This is how the Bishops spend
      more than they receive! One of these days we will go to the trouble and
      expense of bringing the list up to date. Meanwhile it may be noted that
      there is no falling off in the figures towards 1885. No less than five
      bishops died in that year, and they left the following personalities:
      &mdash;£72,000&mdash;£85,000&mdash;£29,000&mdash;£85,000&mdash;£19,000;
      which more than maintain the average.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the poor bishops. As for the rest of the clergy, it is enough
      to say that the Church they belong to has a total revenue of about
      £10,000,000 a year. Probably twice that sum is spent on the sky-pilots of
      all denominations, which is more than is received in wages by all the
      miners in Great Britain. It is a fair calculation that the average
      sky-pilot is six times better paid than the average miner. Yet the latter
      works hard in the bowels of the earth to provide real coals for real
      consumers, while the former is occupied in open air and daylight in
      damping down the imaginary fires of an imaginary hell. It is easy to see
      which is the more useful functionary, just as it is easy to see which is
      the better paid. Let us hope that the miners, and all other workers, will
      lay these facts to heart, and act accordingly. There are too many drones
      in England, living on the common produce of labor. The number of them
      should be diminished, and a beginning should be made with the mystery men.
      Were the great Black Army disbanded, and turned into the ranks of
      productive industry, the evils of society would begin to disappear; for
      those evils are chiefly the result of too much energy and attention being
      devoted to the problematical next life, and too little to the real
      interests of our earthly existence. We should also be spared the wretched
      spectacle of the well-paid drones of theology maundering over the question
      of a "living wage" for the honest men who do the laborious work of the
      world.

    <h2>
      DID BRADLAUGH BACKSLIDE? *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * November 19, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      The <i>Freethinker</i> for October 22 contained a bright article by Mr.
      George Standring, giving an account of a Sunday service which he attended
      at the famous Wesley Chapel in the City-road. The preacher on that
      occasion was the Rev. Allen Rees, and the theme of his discourse was "The
      Death of the <i>National Reformer</i>" Amongst other more or less
      questionable remarks, there was one made by the reverend gentleman, which
      the reporter very justly criticised. What was said by Mr. Rees was
      recorded as follows by Mr. Standring:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, there was reason to believe that Charles Bradlaugh had himself
      materially modified his views before his death, that his Atheism became
      weaker as he grew older. Sir Isaac Holden had told him (Mr. Bees) that Mr.
      Bradlaugh had often spoken to him privately in the House of Commons upon
      religious matters, and had admitted that the conversion of his brother had
      profoundly impressed him. Mr. Bradlaugh had often said to Sir Isaac Holden
      that he often wished he were half as good a man as his brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      To anyone at all acquainted with the relations that existed between Mr.
      Bradlaugh and his brother, the last clause of Mr. Rees's statement is
      sufficient to stamp the whole of it as false and absurd. Without going
      into details, it is enough to say that Mr. Bradlaugh simply <i>could not</i>
      speak of his brother in this manner; it is absolutely beyond the bounds of
      possibility; and, as Sir Isaac Holden is the authority throughout, the
      entire passage about Mr. Bradlaugh would have to be dismissed with
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Standring sent Mr. Rees a marked copy of the <i>Freethinker</i>, and
      intimated that space would probably be afforded him for a correction or an
      explanation. Mrs. Bradlaugh Bonner was also communicated with, and she
      immediately wrote to Mr. Rees on the subject. The reverend gentleman
      replied that he had made "no positive statements" as to any change of view
      on the part of Mr. Bradlaugh. He had "nothing to add" and "nothing to
      retract." But to prevent a misunderstanding he enclosed a verbatim copy of
      the passage in his sermon to which she referred. It ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a rule, men who profess Atheism do not become stronger in their belief
      as time goes on. I think I may almost say that this was true of Mr.
      Bradlaugh. Sir Isaac Holden has told me that he frequently conversed with
      Mr. Bradlaugh on religious subjects. The conversion of his brother deeply
      affected him, and on one occasion he said to him: 'I wish I were half as
      good as my brother.' It was the unreality of much of the Christianity with
      which in early life Mr. Bradlaugh was associated and the worldliness and
      uncharitableness of religious professors, which made an Atheist of Mr.
      Bradlaugh, as it has done of many others."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a precious sample of clerical logic, composition, and veracity.
      Mr. Rees must have been very ignorant of Mr Bradlaugh's writings and
      intellectual character, or else he was deliberately inventing or trusting
      to mere hearsay, when he stated that Mr. Bradlaugh was made an Atheist by
      the bigotry or selfishness of certain Christians. "I think I may almost
      say" is a strange expression. What is it to "almost say" a thing? Is it
      almost said when you have said it? And what a jumble of "hims" in the
      fourth sentence! It would really disgrace a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bradlaugh Bonner replied to Mr. Rees, hoping that his "sense of
      honor" would impel him to acknowledge his mistake. She told him that her
      father's convictions never wavered on his death-bed; that Mr. W. R.
      Bradlaugh was never converted, because he was always a professed
      Christian; that Sir Isaac Holden must be laboring under a misapprehension;
      and that if Mr. Rees would call upon her she would tell him the facts
      which made it "utterly impossible" that her father could have spoken of
      his brother in the way alleged. Mrs. Bonner also wrote to Sir Isaac
      Holden, asking him whether he "really did tell this to the Rev. Allen
      Rees." Sir Isaac Holden did not reply. He is a very old man, years older
      than Mr. Gladstone. This may be an excuse for his manners as well as the
      infirmity of his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rees did reply. He said that "of course" he could not tell an untruth,
      that he had "made no absolute statement," that he "knew he had no positive
      evidence," and that his remark was "a bare suggestion." Having crawled
      away from his clear responsibility, Mr. Rees gratuitously committed
      another offence. "There was," he wrote, "another remark which your father
      uttered at the Hall of Science." Now this <i>is</i> a "positive
      statement." And where is the evidence? "I can give you," Mr. Rees added,
      "the name of the person who heard him say it." According to Mr. Rees,
      therefore, it is only "a bare suggestion" when he gives the authority of
      Sir Isaac Holden, but an anonymous authority is a good basis for a direct,
      unqualified assertion. And what is the "remark" which Mr. Bradlaugh
      "uttered" (what etymology!)?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this&mdash;"A man twenty-five years old may be an iconoclast, but I
      cannot understand a man being one who has passed middle age."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bonner took leave to disbelieve (as she well might) that her father
      had uttered such nonsense. She told Mr. Rees that her father had lectured
      and written as "Iconoclast" till he was thirty-five, and only dropped the
      "fighting name" then because his own name was so well known. She repeated
      her assurance that he had never wavered in his Atheism, and begged Mr.
      Rees to take her father's own written words in preference to "other
      people's versions of his conversation." His <i>Doubts in Dialogue</i>, the
      final paper of which left his hands only three or four days before his
      last illness, would show what his last views were, and she ventured to
      send Mr. Rees a copy for perusal. Mr. Rees read the volume, and, instead
      of admitting that he had been mistaken, he had the impertinence to tell
      Mrs. Bonner that her father's book was full of "sophism" and the "merest
      puerilities," and ended by expressing his "simple contempt." It was
      impertinence on Mr. Rees's part, in both senses of the word, for the merit
      of Mr. Bradlaugh's writing was not the point in consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point was this, Did the writing&mdash;the <i>last</i> writing&mdash;of
      Mr. Bradlaugh show the slightest change in his Atheism? Mr. Rees could not
      see this point, or he would not see it; and either alternative is
      discreditable to a man who sets himself up as a public teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rees did one right thing, however; he sent Mrs. Bonner a letter he had
      received from Sir Isaac Holden, containing the following passage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your rendering of the story is a little different to what I spoke&mdash;'Mr.
      Bradlaugh was affected to tears when I told him that his brother James
      said to the Rev. Richard Allen that his brother Charles was too good a man
      to die an Infidel, and he believed that before his death he would become a
      Christian.' Tears started in his (Charles's) eyes, and he simply replied:
      'My brother James is a <i>good fellow</i>,' not 'I wish I were half as
      good as my brother.' There was evidently a very kind feeling in each of
      the brothers towards each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      What <i>is</i> clear is this&mdash;there is a very bad difference between
      Sir Isaac Holden and the Rev. Allen Rees. "I wish I were half as good as
      my brother" is a very definite expression, and not a bit like "My brother
      James is a good fellow." Now if Sir Isaac Holden <i>did</i> convey this
      expression to the Rev. Allen Rees, the old gentleman has a treacherous
      memory; if he <i>did not</i>, the expression must be ascribed to the
      reverend gentleman's invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bonner replied sharply with "mixed feelings of surprise and
      indignation." Her father had no brother named James. The only brother he
      had was most distinctly not "a good fellow," which there was "documentary
      evidence" to prove. There was also documentary evidence to show that the
      feelings of the brothers towards each other was "the reverse of kindly."
      Mr. Rees had chosen to ignore all this, and, in consequence of his
      attitude, Mrs. Bonner intended to "give this matter publicity"&mdash;which
      she has done by printing the whole correspondence and sending copies to
      the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rees wrote "surprised"&mdash;poor man! He thought it was a "private
      correspondence." He could not understand why he was "personally abused"&mdash;in
      fact, it was "vulgar personal abuse." "I entirely decline," he ended
      majestically, "to have any further correspondence with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sorry display of clerical temper! But it is the way of the
      profession when tackled. They are so used to speaking from the "coward's
      castle," <i>not</i> under correction, that they lose their heads when
      taken to task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bonner appends a note to the correspondence, remarking on "the
      obviously loose reminiscences of Sir Isaac Holden," which Mr. Rees had
      "materially altered," and denying the possibility of any such conversation
      between Sir Isaac Holden and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the private correspondence, surely the conversation (if it occurred)
      was "of a private nature," yet Mr. Rees had no scruple in retailing it
      from the pulpit. Mrs. Bonner adds that her demerits are beside the point,
      which is, "Did Mr. Bradlaugh weaken in his Atheism?" to which she answers
      emphatically "No." She nursed him in his last illness, and her testimony
      is authoritative. Respect for her father's memory justifies her in
      printing this correspondence, and we are glad that she has done so, for it
      nails down another wretched fiction to the counter of truth.

    <h2>
      FREDERIC HARRISON ON ATHEISM. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * January 13,1889.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Frank Harris, the editor of the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, must be a
      sly humorist. In the current number of his magazine he has published two
      articles as opposite to each other as Balaam's blessing on Israel was
      opposite to the curse besought by the King of Moab. Mr. Frederic Harrison
      pitches into Agnosticism with his usual vigor, and holds out Positivism as
      the only system which can satisfy the sceptic and the religionist. Mr. W.
      H. Mallock, on the other hand, makes a trenchant attack on Positivism; and
      the readers of both articles will learn how much may be said against
      anything, or at least anything in the shape of a system. Mr. Herbert
      Spencer, in the name of the Unknowable, proffers his Agnosticism, and Mr.
      Harrison says "Bosh." Mr. Harrison, in the name of Positivism, proffers
      his Religion of Humanity, and Mr. Mallock says "Moonshine." Mr. Spencer is
      a man of genius, and Mr. Harrison and Mr. Mallock are men of remarkable
      talent. Yet, shuffle them how you will, any two of them are ready to damn
      what the third blesses. What does this show? Why, that systems are all
      arbitrary, and suited to a certain order of minds in a certain stage of
      development; and that system-mongers are like spiders, who spin their webs
      out of their own bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harrison's definition of Agnosticism shows it to be merely Atheism in
      disguise. Milton said that new presbyter was but old priest writ large,
      and we may say that the new Agnosticism is but old Atheism written larger&mdash;and
      more respectably. Agnosticism is the cuckoo of philosophy. It appropriates
      the nest of another bird, turns it out in the cold, and even adopts its
      progeny. All the time-honored positions of Atheism&mdash;man's finity and
      nature's infinity, the relativity of human knowledge, the reign of law,
      and so forth&mdash;are quietly monopolised by this intruder, who looks
      upon the object he has despoiled as the Christian looked upon the Jew
      after borrowing his God. Yet in England, the classic land of mental
      timidity and compromise, Agnosticism is almost fashionable, while poor
      Atheism is treated with persecution or obloquy. Elsewhere, especially in
      France, we find a different condition of things. A French sceptic no more
      hesitates to call himself an Atheist than to call himself a Republican.
      May it not be, therefore, that the difference between Agnosticism and
      Atheism is one of temperament? We might illustrate this theory by
      appealing to examples. Darwin was an Agnostic, Professor Clifford an
      Atheist. Or, if we turn to pure literature, we may instance Matthew Arnold
      and Algernon Swinburne. Arnold, the Agnostic, says that "most of what now
      passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry."
      Swinburne, the Atheist, exclaims "Thou art smitten, thou God, thou art
      smitten, thy death is upon thee O Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings out the cardinal&mdash;we might say the <i>only</i>
      distinction between Atheism and Agnosticism. The Agnostic is a timid
      Atheist, and the Atheist a courageous Agnostic. John Bull is infuriated by
      the red cloak of Atheism, so the Agnostic dons a brown cloak with a red
      lining. Now and then a sudden breeze exposes a bit of the fatal red, but
      the garment is promptly adjusted, and Bull forgets the irritating
      phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harrison says "the Agnostic is one who protests against any dogma
      respecting Creation at all, and who deliberately takes his stand on
      ignorance." We cannot help saying that this differences him from the
      Atheist. Seeing that we cannot solve infinite problems, that we know
      nothing, and apparently <i>can</i> know nothing, of God or the
      supernatural, the Atheist has always regarded religious dogmas as blind
      guesses, which, according to the laws of chance, are in all probability
      wrong; and as these blind guesses have almost invariably been associated
      with mental tyranny and moral perversion, he has regarded theology as the
      foe of liberty and humanity. The Agnostic, however, usually adopts a more
      pleasant attitude. He does not believe in attacking theology; and "after
      all, you know," he sometimes says, "we can't tell what there may be behind
      the veil."
    </p>
    <p>
      With his master, Comte, Mr. Harrison "entirely accepts the Agnostic
      position as a matter of logic," but it is only a stepping-stone, and he
      objects to sitting down upon it. Every religion the world has ever seen
      has been false, but religion itself is imperishable, and Positivism has
      found the true solution of the eternal problem. Parsons and Agnostics will
      eventually kiss each other, like righteousness and peace in the text, and
      the then existing High Priest of Positivism will say, "Humanity bless you,
      my children." But all this is for the sweet by-and-bye. Meanwhile the
      Churches thrust out their tongues at Positivism, the great Agnostic
      philosopher calls it the Ghost of Religion, Sir James Stephen declares
      that nobody can worship Comte's made-up Deity, and Mr. Mallock says that
      the love of Humanity, taking it in the concrete, is as foolish as
      Titania's affection for Bottom the Weaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professed Atheists may watch this hubbub with serenity, if not with
      enjoyment. When all is said and done, Atheism remains in possession of the
      sceptical field. Mr. Harrison's flouts, at any rate, will do it no damage.
      His hatred of Atheism is born of jealousy, and like all jealous people he
      is somewhat inconsistent. Here he defines Atheism as a "protest against
      the theological doctrine of a Creator and a moral providence," there he
      defines it as "based on the denial of God," and again he defines it as a
      belief that the universe is "self-existent and purely material." Even
      these do not suffice, for he also adopts Comte's "profound aphorism" that
      "Atheism is the most irrational form of metaphysics," and proves this by a
      fresh definition involved in the charge that "it propounds as the solution
      of an insoluble enigma the hypothesis which of all others is the least
      capable of proof, the least simple, the least plausible, and the least
      useful." <i>Of all others</i> is what Cobbett would have called a beastly
      phrase. It shows Mr. Harrison was in a hurry or a fog. He does not specify
      this unprovable, complex, unplausible, and useless hypothesis. We forbear
      to guess his meaning, but we remind him that Atheism "propounds <i>no</i>
      solution of an insoluble enigma." The Atheist does not say "there is no
      God"; he simply says, "I know not," and ventures to think others are
      equally ignorant. Now, this was Comte's own position. He wished to
      "reorganise Society, without God or King, by the systematic cultus of
      Humanity," and if warning God off from human affairs is not Atheism, we
      should like to know what is. Mr. Harrison lustily sings the praises of
      religion, but he is remarkably silent about Comte's opposition to Theism,
      and in this he is throwing dust in the eyes of English readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In "militant Atheism" Mr. Harrison says that "all who have substantive
      beliefs of their own find nothing but mischief." But this is only Mr.
      Harrison's sweeping style of writing. He is always vivid, and nearly
      always superlative. We venture to think that his "all" merely includes his
      own circle. At the same time, however, we admit that militant Atheism is
      still, as of old, an offence to the superfine sceptics who desire to stand
      well with the great firm of Bumble and Grundy, as well as to the vast army
      of priests and preachers who have a professional interest in keeping
      heresy "dark," and to the ruling and privileged classes, who feel that
      militant Atheism is a great disturber of the peace which is founded on
      popular superstition and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harrison seems to imagine that Atheists have no ideal beyond that of
      attacking theology, but a moment's calm reflection would show him the
      absurdity of this fancy. He might as well suppose that the pioneers of
      civilisation who hew down virgin forests have no conception of the happy
      homesteads they are making room for. We go farther and assert that all
      this talk about negative and positive work is <i>cant</i>. To call the
      destroyer of superstition a negationist is as senseless as to call a
      doctor a negationist. Both strive to expel disease, the one bodily and the
      other mental. Both, therefore, are working for health, and no more
      positive work is conceivable.

    <h2>
      SAVE THE BIBLE! *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * March 26,1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thirty-eight clergymen, a year or two ago, gave the Bible a fresh
      certificate of inspiration and infallibility. They signed a "round robin,"
      if we may apply such a vulgar description to their holy document. But
      somehow the Bible is in as bad a position as ever. It seems, indeed, in
      deadly peril; and if something strong and decisive be not done for its
      protection, it will soon be doomed. Such, at any rate, seems the view of a
      large number of clergymen, who have signed a Petition, prepared by the
      Rev. E. S. Ffoulkes, of St. Mary's, Oxford, and addressed to "the Most
      Reverend the Archbishop, and the Right Reverend the Bishops, of the Church
      of England, in the House of the Convocation of Canterbury assembled." The
      petitioners call upon the Archbishops and Bishops to use "their sacred
      office and authority," and either to purge the Church of heresy or to
      "authoritatively and publicly" recommend certain "orthodox and admirable
      works," which are calculated to "arrest the spread" of "disastrous errors
      in the midst of Our Beloved Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to show the precise nature of these "disastrous errors," we print
      the following paragraphs from the petition:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whereas it is generally known that certain clergymen of the Church of
      England, in positions of influence and authority, are deliberately and
      altogether undermining, by their teachings and public writings, the faith
      of this Church and country in the trustworthiness of the Holy Scriptures,
      and are altogether repudiating the common faith of Christendom, that the
      said Holy Scriptures, as received by this Church of England, are the
      infallible and inspired Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also, that by what is known as the 'New Criticism,' these clergymen do
      attempt entirely to rob the people of God of the Holy Scriptures and
      altogether falsify the teachings respecting them of our Lord Jesus Christ
      and of his Holy Apostles-declaring some parts to be 'myths,' some
      'fables,' some 'the work of dramatists,' etc."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah then, the enemy is within the camp! It is no-longer a question of
      "infidel" publications. Church professors, and doctors of divinity, are
      sapping the very foundations of "the faith." Orthodox clergymen cry out&mdash;in
      the language of this petition&mdash;for salvation from "the dangers of
      Rationalism and unbelief <i>within</i> the Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      What does all this mean? It means that Free-thought is triumphing by the
      permeation of the Churches; that "advanced" ministers are now doing, in a
      sober, steady, scholarly way, the very work so brilliantly inaugurated by
      Voltaire and Thomas Paine; that the Bible is being subjected to rigorous
      criticism, in England as well as in France, Holland, and Germany; that its
      documents are being shifted like the pieces in a kaleidoscope, and every
      turn of the instrument makes them differ more and more from the orthodox
      pattern. At present, it is true, the process is almost confined to the Old
      Testament. There, however, it is nearly completed. Presently it will
      extend in earnest to the New Testament; and when it is completed <i>there</i>,
      the Bible will be something worse than Luther's "wax nose," it will be a
      thing of "shreds and patches."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Testament criticism by men like Driver, Cheyne, Ryle, and Gore, is
      indeed&mdash;as the petitioners assert&mdash;destroying faith in "the Holy
      Scriptures" as the "infallible and inspired Word o\c God." They still
      pretend it is <i>inspired</i>, but not infallible. "Infallible," at this
      time of day, is a very "large order." Professor Bruce, himself a Christian
      minister, is obliged to tell his orthodox brethren that "the errorless
      autograph for which some so zealously contend is a theological figment."
      "The Bible," he reminds them, "was produced piecemeal, and by the time the
      later portions were produced the earlier had lost their supposed
      immaculate-ness." And he warns the "infallible" gentlemen that their
      position is really "perilous" when it is considered "in what state we
      possess the Scriptures now." Yes, it is only country curates who can stand
      up now for an "infallible" Word of God; even Mr. Gladstone is obliged to
      admit "errors"&mdash;that is, errors in general, for he will not confess
      any in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reference in the petition to "myths," "fables," and "the work of
      dramatists," seem to be specially aimed at the Rev. Charles Gore, the
      Principal of Pusey House, Oxford, and editor of <i>Lux Mundi</i>. His
      essay in that volume on "The Holy Spirit and Inspiration" is horribly
      distasteful to orthodox parsons. They cannot refute him, but they say "he
      ought to know better," or "he shouldn't write such things"&mdash;in other
      words, he is guilty of the shocking crime of letting the cat out of the
      bag. He discards the Creation Story, just like Professor Bruce, who calls
      the fall of Adam a "quaint" embodiment of the theological conception of
      sin. He dismisses all the patriarchs before Abraham as "mythical." He
      admits the late origin of the Pentateuch, and only claims for Moses the
      probable authorship of the Decalogue. He says the Song of Solomon is "of
      the nature of a drama." The Book of Job is "mainly dramatic." Deuteronomy
      is the publication of the law "put dramatically" into the mouth of Moses.
      Jonah and Daniel are "dramatic compositions." Jesus Christ, it is true,
      cited both as historical; but he only "accommodated" himself to the
      prevalent belief. He knew better, but he did not choose to say so; or,
      rather, the moment was inopportune; so he left us to find out the truth in
      this matter, as he left us to find it out in everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canon Driver is perhaps glanced at in "fables," and perhaps also Canon
      Cheyne. The former has publicly argued against the "reconciliations" of
      Genesis and Science. He has likewise written very strongly against the
      "historical" character of Jonah, which he treats as a story with "a
      moral." Canon Cheyne regards it as "an allegory." Jonah is Israel,
      swallowed up by Babylon; but, seeking the Lord in exile, the captive is at
      last disgorged uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      These clerical apostles of the "New Criticism" are accused of attempting
      "entirely to rob the people of God of the Holy Scriptures." Poor people of
      God! How anxious the petitioners are for their welfare! Some persons,
      however, will be apt to regard the solicitude of these gentlemen as <i>professional</i>.
      Robbing the people of the Holy Scriptures, in <i>their</i> mouths, may
      simply mean rendering the clergyman's trade more difficult, or perhaps
      altogether impossible; and therefore the bitter cry of these "grievously
      beset" parsons (to use their own words) may be only a parallel to the
      famous old shout of "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why indeed do not the petitioners refute the apostles of the "New
      Criticism," instead of appealing to the <i>authority</i> of Convocation?
      They plainly declare that the "New Criticis" rests on "utterly baseless
      foundations"&mdash;which is a curious pleonasm or tautology for a body of
      "educated" gentlemen. But if the substance of the declaration be true,
      apart from its logic or grammar, the orthodox parsons may scatter the
      heretical parsons like chaff before the wind. Principles which are
      "utterly baseless" may surely be refuted. To quote from Hamlet, "it is as
      easy as lying." Now that is a practice in which the clergy of all ages
      have shown great dexterity. We therefore hope the orthodox parsons will <i>refute</i>
      the "New Criticism." Let them try to save the Bible by argument. If they
      cannot it is lost, and lost for ever.

      FORGIVE AND FORGET. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * March 19, 1893. Written after a debate at the Hall of
     Science, London, between the writer and the Rev. C. Fleming
     Williams, on "Christian Ideas of Man and Methods of
     Progress." Mr. Branch, of the London County Council,
     presided, and there was a very large attendance.
</pre>
    <p>
      My recent friendly discussion with the Rev. C. Fleming Williams was most
      enjoyable. It is so-pleasant to debate points of difference with an
      opponent whom you fully respect, towards whom you have not an atom of ill
      feeling, and to whom you disclose your own views in exchange for the
      confidence of his. The chairman said that he had visited the Hall of
      Science many years ago, and frequently heard discussions, but they were
      generally acrimonious, and seldom profitable. No doubt he spoke what he
      felt to be the truth; at the same time, however, he probably left out of
      sight a very important factor, namely, the tone and temper which Christian
      critics are apt to display on a Secular platform; the assumed superiority,
      which is not justified by any apparent gifts of intelligence; the
      implication in most of their remarks that the Freethinker is on a lower
      moral level than they are, though it would never be suspected by an
      indifferent observer; the arrogance which is often the undercurrent of
      their speech, and sometimes bursts forth into sheer, undisguised
      insolence. Christian critics of this species have, perhaps, stung
      Freethought lecturers into hot resentment, when it would have been far
      preferable to keep cool, and continue using the rapier instead of seizing
      the bludgeon. It is always a mistake to lose one's temper, but it becomes
      excusable (although not justifiable) under intense provocation. On the
      whole, it is safe to say that Christians have received more courtesy than
      they have shown in their controversies with Freethinkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the debate itself. What I want to deal with in this article is
      the plea of the chairman, and also of Mr. Williams, for a more charitable
      understanding. Christians have abused, ill-treated, and even butchered
      Freethinkers in the past, but the best Christians are ashamed of it now.
      Let us then, it is urged, bury the past; let us forgive and forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as it concerns <i>men</i> only I am not insensible to the appeal.
      Far be it from me to blame Mr. Williams for the follies and malignancies
      of his Christian predecessors. On a question of character, of merit or
      demerit, every man stands or falls alone. Imputed wickedness is just as
      irrational as imputed righteousness. I no more wish to make Mr. Williams
      responsible for the butcheries of a Torquemada or an Alva than I wish to
      be saved by the sufferings of Jesus Christ. So far as Mr. Williams is
      concerned, I have no past to bury. I am not aware that he has ever desired
      anything but absolute justice for all forms of opinion; and I know that he
      denounced my imprisonment for the artificial crime of "blasphemy."
      Evidently, then, Mr. Williams' plea is more than personal. It is really a
      request that I should judge Christianity, as a great, ancient, historic
      system, not by what it has in the main taught and done, but by what a
      select body of its professors say and do in the present generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this is a plea which I must reject. In the first place, while I admit
      it is unfair to judge Christianity by its <i>worst</i> specimens, I regard
      it as no less unfair to judge it by its <i>best</i>. This is not justice
      and impartiality. The Chief Constable of Hull* is probably as sincere a
      Christian as Mr. Williams. I have to meet them both, and I must take them
      as I find them. The one pays me a compliment, and the other threatens me
      with a prosecution; one shakes me cordially by the hand, the other tries
      to prevent me from lecturing. The difference between them is flagrant. But
      how am I to put Mr. Williams to the credit of Christianity, and Captain
      Gurney to the credit of something else? What <i>is</i> the something else?
      They both speak to me as Christians; is it for me to say that the one is a
      Christian and the other is not? Is not that a domestic question for the
      Christians to settle among themselves? And am I not just and reasonable in
      declining to take the decision out of their hands?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This gentleman was trying to prevent me from delivering
     Sunday lectures at Hull under the usual condition of a
     charge for admission.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the next place, since Christianity is, as I have said, not only a
      great, but an ancient and historic system, its past <i>cannot</i> be
      buried, and should not be if it could. History is philosophy teaching us
      by example. Without it the present is meaningless, and the future an
      obscurity. Now history shows us that Christianity has been steady and
      relentless in the persecution of heresy. We have therefore to inquire the
      reason. It will not do to say that persecution is natural to human pride
      in face of opposition; for Buddhism, which is older than Christianity, has
      not been guilty of a single act of persecution in the course of
      twenty-four centuries. Another explanation is necessary. And what is it?
      When we look into the matter we find that persecution has always been
      justified, nay inculcated, by appealing to Christian doctrines and the
      very language of Scripture. Unbelief was treason against God, and the
      rejection of Christ was rebellion. They were more than operations of the
      intellect; they were movements of the will&mdash;not mistaken, but
      satanic. And as faith was essential to salvation, and heresy led straight
      to hell, the elimination of the heretic was in the interest of the people
      he might divert from the road to paradise. It was simply an act of social
      sanitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that this conception is not paraded by "advanced" Christians,
      though they seldom renounce it in decisive language. But these "advanced"
      Christians are the children of a later age, full of intellectual and moral
      influences which are foreign to, or at least independent of, Christianity.
      Their attitude is the resultant of several forces. But suppose a time of
      reaction came, and the influences I have referred to should diminish for a
      season; is it not probable, nay certain, that the old forces of Christian
      exclusiveness and infallibility, based upon a divine revelation, would
      once more produce the effects-which cursed and degraded Europe for over a
      thousand years? Such, at any rate, is my belief; it is also, I think, the
      belief of most Freethinkers; and this is the reason why we cannot forgive
      and forget. The serpent is scotched, not slain; and we must beware of its
      fangs.

    <h2>
      THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matthew, or whoever was the author of the first Gospel, had a rare eye (or
      nose) for portents and prodigies. He seems also to have had exclusive
      sources of information. Several of the wonderful things he relates were
      quite unknown to the other evangelists. They were ignorant of the
      wholesale resurrection of saints at the crucifixion, and also of the watch
      at the sepulchre, with all the pretty circumstantial story depending upon
      it. At the other end of Christ's career they never heard of the visit of
      the wise men of the east to his cradle, or of Herod's massacre of the
      innocents, or of the star which guided those wise men to the birthplace of
      the little king of the Jews. That star is the sole property of Matthew,
      and the other evangelists took care not to infringe his copyright. Indeed,
      it is surprising how well they did with the remnants he left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew was not a Jules Verne. He had no knowledge of astronomy.
      Consequently he did not make the most of that travelling star. It was seen
      by wise men "in the east." This is not very exact, but it is precise
      enough for a fairy tale. Those wise men happened to be "in the east" at
      the same time. They were really "Magi"&mdash;as may be seen in the Revised
      Version; that is, priests of the religion of Persia; and it requires a lot
      of faith to see what concern they could possibly have with the bantling of
      Bethlehem. However, they saw "his star," and they appear to have followed
      it. They must have slept by day and journeyed by night, when the star was
      visible. At the end of their expedition this star "stood over" the house
      where little Jesus was lying. Truly, it was a very accommodating star. Of
      course it was specially provided for the occasion. Real stars, rolling
      afar in the infinite ether, are too distant to "stand over" a particular
      spot on this planet This was an ideal star. It travelled through the
      earth's atmosphere, and moved according to the requirements of the gospel
      Munchausen. What became of it afterwards we are not informed. Probably it
      was born and died in Matthew's imagination. He blew it out when he had
      done with it, and thus it has escaped the attention of Sir Robert Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those star-gazing magi went into "the house," which, according to Luke,
      was an inn; Jesus Christ having been born in the stable, because the "pub"
      was full, and no gentleman would go outside to oblige a lady: They opened
      their Gladstone bags, and displayed the presents they had brought for the
      little king of the Jews. These were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. No
      doubt the perfumes were very welcome&mdash;in a stable; and very likely
      Joseph took care of the gold till Jesus was old enough to spend it on his
      own account, by which time it appears to have vanished, perhaps owing to
      the expenses of bringing up the numerous progeny of the Virgin Mother.
      Then the Mahatmas&mdash;we beg pardon, the Magi&mdash;went home. Perhaps
      they are there still. But no matter. We leave that to the Christian
      Evidence Society, or the Theosophists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candid students will see at a glance that the whole of this story is
      mythological. Like other distinguished persons, the Prophet of Nazareth
      had to make a fuss, not only in the world, but in the universe; and his
      biographers (especially Matthew) duly provided him with extraordinary
      incidents. Not only was he born, like so many other "saviors," without the
      assistance of a human father, but his birth was heralded by a celestial
      marvel. There was a star of his nativity. The wise men from the east
      called it "his star." This puts him in the category of heroes, and bars
      the idea of his being a god. It also shows that the Christians, amongst
      whom this story originated, were devotees of astrology. Fortune-tellers
      still decide your "nativity" before they cast your "horoscope." We are
      aware that many commentators have discussed the star of Christ's birth
      from various points of view. Some have thought it a real star; others have
      had enough astronomy to see that this was impossible, and have argued that
      it was a big will-o'-the-wisp, created and directed by supernatural power,
      like the pillar of day-cloud and night-fire that led the Jews in the
      wilderness; while still others have favored the idea of a supernatural
      illusion, which was confined to the wise men&mdash;and thus it was that
      the "star" was not seen or mentioned by any of their contemporaries. But
      all this is the usual mixture of Bible commentators. There is really no
      need to waste time in that fashion. The Star of Bethlehem belongs to the
      realm of poetry, as much as the Star of Caesar, to which the mighty Julius
      ascended in his apotheosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of sermons have been preached on that Star of Bethlehem, and
      these also have been works of imagination. We have been told, for
      instance, that it was the morning star of a new day for humanity. But this
      is a falsehood, which the clergy palmed off on ignorant congregations. The
      world was happier under the government of the great Pagan emperors than it
      has ever been under the dominion of Christianity. For a thousand years the
      triumph of the Cross was the annihilation of everything that makes life
      pleasant and dignified. The Star of Bethlehem shone in a sky of utter
      blackness. All the constellations of science, art, philosophy, and
      literature were in disastrous eclipse. Cruelty and hypocrisy abounded on
      earth, toil and misery were the lot of the people, and bloodshed was as
      common as rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religions, said Schopenhauer, are like glow-worms; they require darkness
      to shine in. This was quite true of Christianity. It was splendid when it
      had no competitor. To be visible&mdash;above all, to be worshipped&mdash;it
      needed the sky to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one, during the past three hundred years, the stars of civilisation
      have emerged from their long eclipse, and now the sky of humanity is full
      of countless hosts of throbbing glories. The Star of Bethlehem is no
      longer even a star of the first magnitude. It pales and dwindles every
      year. In another century it will be a very minor light. Meanwhile it is
      drawn big on the maps of faith. But that little trick is being seen
      through. Once it was the Star of Bethlehem first, and the rest nowhere;
      now it takes millions of money, and endless special pleading, to keep its
      name on the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ himself is coming more and more to be regarded as a fanciful
      figure; not God, not even a man, but a construction of early Christian
      imagination. "Why," asked a Unitarian of a Positivist, "why is not Christ
      in your Positivist calendar?" "Because," was the reply, "the calendar is
      for men, not for gods."

    <h2>
      THE GREAT GHOSTS *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * March, 1889.
</pre>
    <p>
      Long before there were any kings there were chiefs, Even in the early
      Feudal days the king was only the chief of the barons, and many centuries
      elapsed before the supremacy of the monarch was unquestioned and he became
      really the <i>sovereign</i>. It was a process of natural selection. A mob
      of chiefs could not rule a mob of people. There was a fierce struggle,
      with plenty of fighting and intrigue, and the fittest survived. Gradually,
      as the nation became unified, the government was centralised, and out of
      the chaos of competing nobles emerged the relatively cosmic authority of
      the Crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly in the world of religion. All gods were originally ghosts. But
      as polytheism declined a supreme god emerged from the crowd of deities, as
      the king emerged from the crowd of nobles, and ruled from a definite
      centre. It was Zeus in Greece, Jupiter in Rome, Brahma in India, Thor in
      Scandinavia, and Yahveh in Israel. "I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous
      God," was an exclamation that sprang from Yahveh's lips (through his
      priests) when his godship was still in the thick of the competitive
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghosts become gods, and the gods become supreme deities, looked after
      the interests of their worshippers; gave them long life, good harvests,
      and prosperity in warfare, if they were true to them, and plagued them
      like the very devil if they slighted them or nodded to their rivals.
      According to the Old Testament, when everything went well with the Jews
      their God was pleased, and when things went wrong with them he was angry.
      This state of mind survives into our advanced civilisation, where people
      still talk of "judgments," still pray for good things, and still implore
      their God for victory when they have a scrimmage with their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this infantile conception is dying out of educated minds. Prayer is
      seen to be futile. The laws of nature do not vary. Providence is on the
      side of the big battalions. God helps those who help themselves&mdash;and
      no one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago, in ancient Greece and Rome, the acutest thinkers had come to the
      same conclusion. Lucretius, for instance, did not deny the existence of
      the gods; he merely asserted that they no longer concerned themselves with
      human affairs, which he was heartily glad of, as they were mostly bad
      characters. He observed "the reign of law" as clearly as our modern
      scientists, and relegated the deities to their Olympian repose, so
      beautifully versed by Tennyson.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              The Gods, who haunt
     The lucid interspace of world and world,
     Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,
     Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,
     Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
     Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
     Their savored everlasting calm.
</pre>
    <p>
      Even the savage, in times of prolonged peace and prosperity, begins to
      speculate on the possibility of his god's having retired from business;
      for religion is born of fear, not of love, and the savage is reminded of
      his god by calamity rather than good fortune. This idea has been caught by
      Robert Browning in his marvellous <i>Caliban upon Setebos</i>, a poem
      developed out of a casual germ in Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hoping the while, since evils sometimes mend,
     Warts rub away and sores are cured with slime,
     That some strange day, will either the Quiet catch
     And conquer Setebos, or likelier He
     Decrepit may doze, doze, as good as die.
</pre>
    <p>
      But presently poor Caliban is frightened out of his speculation by a
      thunderstorm, which makes him lie low and slaver his god, offering any
      mortification as the price of his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a good deal of Caliban in our modern multitudes, but the educated
      are working free from his theology. Science and miracle cannot live
      together, and miracle and providence are the same thing. How far from us
      is the good old God of the best parts of the Bible, who held out one ear
      for the prayers of his good children, and one hand, well rodded, for the
      backs of the naughty ones. The seed of the righteous never begged for
      bread, and the villain always came to a bad end. It was the childish
      philosophy of the "gods" in a modern theatre. The more critical want
      something truer and more natural, something more accordant with the stern
      realities of life. Renan has some excellent remarks on this in the Preface
      to his second volume of the <i>Histoire du Peuple d' Israel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The work of the genius of Israel was not really affected until the
      eighteenth century after Jesus Christ, when it became very doubtful to
      spirits a little cultivated that the affairs of this world are regulated
      by a God of justice. The exaggerated idea of a special Providence, the
      basis of Judaism and Islam, and which Christianity has only corrected
      through the fund of liberalism inherent in our races, has been
      definitively vanquished by modern philosophy, the fruit not of abstract
      speculation, but of constant experience. It has never been observed, in
      effect, that a superior being occupies himself, for a moral or an immoral
      purpose, with the affairs of nature or the affairs of humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenan has elsewhere said that the negation of the supernatural is a dogma
      with every cultivated intelligence. God, in short, has faded into a
      metaphysical abstraction. The little ghosts vanished long ago, and now the
      Great Ghost is melting into thin air. Thousands of people have lost all
      belief in his existence. They use his name, and take it in vain; for when
      questioned, they merely stand up for "a sort of a something." The fear of
      God, so to speak, has survived his personality; just as Madame de Stael
      said she did not believe in ghosts, but she was afraid of them. Mrs.
      Browning gives voice to this sentiment in one of her poems:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And hearts say, God be pitiful,
     That ne'er said, God be blest.
</pre>
    <p>
      The fear of the Lord is, indeed, the beginning and the end of theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Great Ghost was a reality&mdash;we mean to his worshippers&mdash;he
      was constantly spoken of. His name was invoked in the courts of law, it
      figured in nearly every oath outside them, and it was to be seen on nearly
      every page of every book that was published. But all that is changed. To
      speak or print the name of God is reckoned "bad form." The word is almost
      tabooed in decent society. You hear it in the streets, however, when the
      irascible carman calls on God to damn your eyes for getting in his way.
      There is such a conspiracy of silence about the Great Ghost, except in
      churches and chapels, that the mention of his name in polite circles
      sounds like swearing. Eyebrows are lifted, and the speaker is looked upon
      as vulgar, and perhaps dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus theology gives way to the pressure of science, and religion to the
      pressure of civilisation. The more use we make of this life the less we
      look for another; the loftier man grows the less he bows to ghosts and
      gods. Heaven and hell both disappear, and things are neither so bad nor
      good as was expected. Man finds himself in a universe of necessity. He
      hears no response to his prayers but the echo of his own voice. He
      therefore bids the gods adieu, and sets himself to the task of making the
      best of life for himself and his fellows. Without false hopes, or bare
      fears, he steers his course over the ocean of life, and says with the
      poet, "I am the captain of my soul."

    <h2>
      ATHEISM AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * July, 1889.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sunday, July 14, is the hundredth anniversary of the fall of the Bastille,
      and the occasion will be splendidly celebrated at Paris. In itself the
      capture of this prison-fortress by the people was not a wonderful
      achievement; it was ill-defended, and its governor might, had he chosen,
      have exploded the powder magazine and blown it sky-high. But the event was
      the parting of the ways. It showed that the multitude had got the bit
      between its teeth, and needed a more potent master than the poor king at
      Versailles. And the event itself was a striking one. Men are led by
      imagination, and the Bastille was the symbol of centuries of oppression.
      Within its gloomy dungeons hundreds of innocent men had perished in
      solitary misery, without indictment or trial, consigned to death-in-life
      by the arbitrary order of irresponsible power. Men of the most eminent
      intellect and character had suffered within its precincts for the crime of
      teaching new truth or exposing old superstitions. Voltaire himself had
      twice tasted imprisonment there. What wonder, then, that the people fixed
      their gaze upon it on that ominous fourteenth of July, and attacked it as
      the very citadel of tyranny? The Bastille fell, and the sound re-echoed
      through Europe. It was the signal of a new era and a new hope. The
      Revolution had begun&mdash;that mighty movement which, in its meaning and
      consequences, dwarfs every other cataclysm in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But revolutions do not happen miraculously. Their advent is prepared. They
      are as much <i>caused</i> as the fall of a ripe apple from the tree, or
      the regular bursting of the buds in spring. The authors of the Revolution
      were in their graves. Its leaders, or its instruments, appeared upon the
      scene in '89. After life's fitful fever Voltaire was sleeping well.
      Rousseau's tortured heart was at rest. Diderot's colossal labors were
      ended; his epitaph was written, and the great Encyclopaedia remained as
      his living monument. D'Holbach had just joined his friends in their
      eternal repose. A host of smaller men, also, but admirable soldiers of
      progress in their degree, had passed away. The gallant host had done its
      work. The ground was ploughed, the seed was sown, and the harvest was
      sure. Famished as they were, and well-nigh desperate at times, the men of
      the Revolution nursed the crop as a sacred legacy, shedding their blood
      like water to fructify the soil in which it grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superficial readers are ignorant of the mental ferment which went on in
      France before the Revolution. Voltaire's policy of sapping the dogmas by
      which all tyranny was supported had been carried out unflinchingly. Not
      only had Christianity been attacked in every conceivable way, with
      science, scholarship, argument, and wit; but the very foundations of all
      religion&mdash;the belief in soul and God&mdash;had not been spared. The
      Heresiarch of Ferney lived to see the war with superstition carried
      farther than he contemplated or desired; but it was impossible for him to
      say to the tide of Freethought, "Thus far shalt thou go and no farther,
      and here shall thy proud waves be stayed." The tide poured on over
      everything sacred. Altars, thrones, and coronets met with a common fate.
      True, they were afterwards fished out of the deluge; but their glory was
      for ever quenched, their power for ever gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the great Atheists who prepared the Revolution we single out two&mdash;Diderot
      and D'Holbach. The sagacious mind of Comte perceived that Diderot was the
      greatest <i>thinker</i> of the band. The fecundity of his mind was
      extraordinary, and even more so his scientific prescience. Anyone who
      looks through the twenty volumes of his collected works will be astonished
      at the way in which, by intuitive insight, he anticipated so many of the
      best ideas of Evolution. His labors on the Encyclopaedia would have tired
      out the energies of twenty smaller men, but he persevered to the end,
      despite printers, priests, and governments, and a countless host of other
      obstructions. Out of date as the work is now, it was the artillery of the
      movement of progress then. As Mr. Morley says, it "rallied all that was
      best in France round the standard of light and social hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Less original, but nearly as bold and industrious, D'Holbach placed his
      fortune and abilities at the service of Freethought. Mr. Morley calls the
      <i>System of Nature</i> "a thunderous engine of revolt." It was Atheistic
      in religion, and revolutionary in politics. It challenged every enemy of
      freedom in the name of reason and humanity. Here and there its somewhat
      diffuse rhetoric was lit up with the splendidly concise eloquence of
      Diderot, who touched the work with a master-hand. Nor did this powerful
      book represent a tithe of D'Holbach's labors for the "good old cause." His
      active pen produced a score of other works, under various names and
      disguises, all addressed to the same object&mdash;the destruction of
      superstition and the emancipation of the human mind. They were extensively
      circulated, and must have created a powerful impression on the reading
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving its authors and precursors, and coming to the Revolution itself,
      we find that its most distinguished figures were Atheists. Mirabeau, the
      first Titan of the struggle, was a godless statesman. In him the multitude
      found a master, who ruled it by his genius and eloquence, and his
      embodiment of its aspirations. The crowned king of France was pottering in
      his palace, but the real king reigned in the National Assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Girondists were nearly all Atheists, from Condorcet and Madame Roland
      down to the obscurest victims of the Terror who went gaily to their doom
      with the hymn of freedom upon their proud lips. Danton also, the second
      Titan of the Revolution, was an Atheist. He fell in trying to stop the
      bloodshed, which Robespierre, the Deist, continued until it drowned him.
      With Danton there went to the guillotine another Atheist, bright, witty
      Camille Desmoulins, whose exquisite pen had served the cause well, and
      whose warm poet's blood was destined to gush out under the fatal knife.
      Other names crowd upon us, too numerous to recite. To give them all would
      be to write a catalogue of the revolutionary leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atheism was the very spirit of the Revolution. This has been admitted by
      Christian writers, who have sought revenge by libelling the movement.
      Their slanders are manifold, but we select two which are found most
      impressive at orthodox meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is stated that the Revolutionists organised a worship of the Goddess of
      Reason, that they went in procession to Notre Dame, where a naked woman
      acted the part of the goddess, while Chenier's <i>Ode</i> was chanted by
      the Convention. Now there is a good deal of smoke in this story and very
      little flame. The naked female is a pious invention, and that being gone,
      the calumny is robbed of its sting. Demoiselle Candeille, an actress, was
      selected for her beauty; but she was not a "harlot," and she was not
      undressed. Whoever turns to such an accessible account as Carlyle's will
      see that the apologists of Christianity have utterly misrepresented the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, it is asserted that the Revolution was a tornado of murder;
      cruelty was let loose, and the Atheists waded in blood. Never was greater
      nonsense paraded with a serious face. During the Terror itself the total
      number of victims, as proved by the official records, was less than three
      thousand; not a tenth part of the number who fell in the single massacre
      of St. Bartholomew!
    </p>
    <p>
      But who caused the Terror? The Christian monarchies that declared war on
      Freethinkers and regicides. Theirs was the guilt, and they are responsible
      for the bloodshed. France trembled for a moment. She aimed at the traitors
      within her borders, and struck down many a gallant friend in error. But
      she recovered from the panic. Then her sons, half-starved, ragged,
      shoeless, ill-armed, marched to the frontier, hurled back her enemies, and
      swept the trained armies of Europe into flight. They <i>would</i> be free,
      and who should say them nay? They were not to be terrified or deluded by
      "the blood on the hands of the king or the lie at the lips of the priest."
      And if the struggle developed until the French armies, exchanging defence
      for conquest, thundered over Europe, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean,
      from the orange-groves of Spain to the frozen snows of Russia&mdash;the
      whole blame rests with the pious scoundrels who would not let France
      establish a Republic in peace.

    <h2>
      PIGOTTISM. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * March, 1889.

     "<i>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is
     new? it hath been already of old times, which was before
     us.</i>"&mdash;Ecclesiastes i. 10.
</pre>
    <p>
      Everybody is talking about the flight of Pigott. The flight into Egypt
      never caused half such a sensation. Pigott has gone off into the infinite.
      He was shadowed, but he has performed the feat of running away from his
      own shadow. Where he will turn up next, or if he will turn up anywhere,
      God only knows. But wherever he re-appears&mdash;in the South Pacific as a
      missionary, in America as a revivalist, or in India as an avatar&mdash;it
      will be the same old Pigott, lying, shuffling, forging and blackmailing,
      with an air of virtue and benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edifice of calumny on Mr. Parnell and his closest colleagues rested on
      the foundation of Pigott, and Pigott is exploded. He has entirely
      vanished. Not a hair of him is visible. He is gone like last winter's snow
      or last summer's roses. He is in the big list of things Wanted. But
      advertisements will not bring him back, and considering who is in power,
      it is very problematical if the officers of justice will be any more
      successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no wish to be disrespectful to the Commission, and it is far from
      our intention to pronounce judgment on a case which is <i>sub judice</i>,
      though who can help sundry exclamations when the chief witness on one side
      bolts, leaving no trace but a few more lies and counter lies? Our object,
      indeed, is not political but religious. We desire to make the noble Pigott
      point a moral and adorn a tale. He and his achievements in connection with
      the <i>Times</i> splendidly illustrate the process by which Christianity
      was built up. Pigottism was at work for centuries, forging documents,
      manufacturing evidence, and telling the grossest lies with an air of
      truth. What is still worse, Pigottism was so lucky as to get into the seat
      of despotic power, and to crush out all criticism of its frauds; so that,
      at length, everyone believed what no one heard questioned. It was
      Pigottism in excelsis. The liar gave evidence in the witness box, stifled
      or murdered the counsel for the opposite side, then mounted the bench to
      give judgment in his own favor, and finally pronounced a decree of death
      against all who refused to own him the pink of veracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just look for a moment at these Parnell letters. They were printed in
      facsimile in the <i>Times</i>, published in <i>Parnellism and Crime</i>,
      circulated among millions of people, and accepted as genuine by half the
      population of England. And on what ground? Solely on the ground that
      Parnellism was heterodox and the <i>Times</i> was a respectable journal.
      That was enough. The laws of evidence were treated with contempt.
      Investigation was thought unnecessary. Thousands of people fatuously said,
      "Oh, the letters are in print." And all this in an age of Board schools,
      printing presses, daily papers, and unlimited discussion; nay, in despite
      of the solemn declaration of Mr. Parnell and his colleagues, backed up by
      a demand for investigation, that the letters were absolute concoctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if such things can happen in an age like this, how easily could they
      happen in ages like those in which Christianity produced its scriptures.
      Credulity was boundless, fraud was audacious, and lying for the profit of
      the Church was regarded as a virtue. There was no printing press, no free
      inquiry, no keen investigation, no vivid conception of the laws of
      evidence; and the few brilliant critics, like Celsus and Porphyry, who
      kept alive in their breasts the nobler spirit of Grecian scepticism, were
      answered by the destruction of their writings, a process which was carried
      out with the cunning scent of a sleuth-hound and the remorseless cruelty
      of a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church produced, quite as mysteriously as the <i>Times</i>, certain
      documents which it said were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter,
      Paul, and James. Others were written by Pagans like Pilate, and one at
      least by Jesus Christ himself. No commission sat to examine and
      investigate, no Sir Charles Russell cross-examined the witnesses. The
      Pigotts, the Houstons, and the Macdonalds kept quietly in the background,
      and were never dragged forth into the light of day. The Mr. Walters took
      the full responsibility, which was very trifling; and as Englishmen relied
      on the respectability of the <i>Times</i>, so the illiterate and fanatical
      Christians relied on the respectability of the Mother Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those documents, so mysteriously produced, were as mysteriously
      dropped when they had served their turn. Hence the so-called Apocryphal
      New Testament, a collection of writings as ancient, and once as accepted,
      as those found in the Canon. Hence also the relics, either in name or in
      fragments, of a host of gospels, epistles, and revelations, which
      primitive Pigottism manufactured for the behoof of Christianity, Every
      single scrap no doubt subserved a useful end. But whatever was no longer
      required was discarded like the scaffolding of a house. The real,
      permanent work, all the while, was going on inside; and when the Church
      faced the world with its completed edifice, it thought itself provided
      with something that would stand all winds and weathers. It was found,
      however, in the course of time, that Pigottism was still necessary. Hence
      the Apostolic Constitutions, the Decretals, the Apostles' and the
      Athanasian Creeds, and all the profitable relics of saints and martyrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two hundred years ago an informal Commission began to sit on these
      Christian documents. The precious letter of Jesus Christ to Abgarus soon
      flew off with the Veronica handkerchief, and many other products of
      Christian Pigottism shared the same fate. The witnesses were examined and
      cross-examined, and the longer the process lasted the sorrier was the
      spectacle they presented. Paul's epistles have been shockingly handled.
      The Commission has positively declared that all but four of them are
      forgeries, and is still investigating the claim of the remnant under
      reprieve. Nor is the judgment on the gospels less decisive. The Court has
      decided that they were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Who
      wrote them, when they were written, or where, is left to the Day of
      Judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the press has given little attention to the proceedings in
      this Court of Commission. Its reports are published in expensive volumes
      for scholars and gentlemen of means and leisure. Some of the results,
      indeed, are given in a few journals written for the people; but these
      journals are boycotted as vulgar, unless they go too far, when they are
      prosecuted for blasphemy. Yet the truth is gradually leaking out. People
      shake their heads ominously, especially when there is anything in them;
      and parsons are looked upon with a growing suspicion. They look bland,
      they assume the most virtuous airs, and sometimes they affect a
      preternatural goodness. But in all this they are excelled by the noble
      Pigott, whose bald head, venerable beard, and benevolent appearance,
      qualified him to sit for a portrait of God the Father. Gentlemen, it won't
      do. You will have to bolt or confess. The documents you have palmed off on
      the world are the products of unadulterated Pigottism. You know it, we
      know it, and by and bye everyone will know it.

    <h2>
      JESUS AT THE DERBY. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * June, 1890.
</pre>
    <p>
      This is the age of advertisement. Look at the street-hoardings, look at
      the newspapers, look at our actor-managers, look at Barnum. Scream from
      the housetops or you stand no chance. If you cannot attract attention in
      any other way, stand on your head. Get talked about somehow. The only hell
      is obscurity, and notoriety is the seventh heaven. If you cannot make a
      fortune, spend one. Run through a quarter of a million in three years, be
      the fool of every knave, and though you are as commonplace as a wet day in
      London, you shall find a host of envious admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the worst come to the worst, you can defy obscurity by committing a
      judiciously villainous murder. Perhaps Jack the Ripper had a passion for
      publicity, and liked to see his name in the papers; until he grew <i>blase</i>
      and retired upon his laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is an advertising age, and an advertising age is a sensational
      age. Religion itself&mdash;the staid, the demure&mdash;shares in the
      general tendency. She preaches in the style of the auction room, she beats
      drums and shakes tambourines in the streets, she affects criminals and
      dotes on vice, she bustles about the reformation of confirmed topers.
      By-and-bye she will get up a mission to lunatics and idiots. She is now a
      very "forward" person. Forward movements are the rage in all the churches.
      But Methodism bears the palm, though Presbyterianism threatens to run it
      hard in the person of John McNeill. Hugh Price Hughes is a very smart
      showman. When truth is stale he is ready with a bouncing lie, and has
      "face" enough to keep it up in five chapters. But the West-End Mission is
      getting rather tame. The dukes and duchesses are not yet converted. Money
      is spent like water and the aristocracy still go to Hades. A new move is
      tried. The "forward" Methodists organise a Mission to Epsom, Jesus Christ
      goes to the Derby; that is, he goes by proxy, in the person of Mr. Nix. A
      van, a tent, and a big stock of pious literature, with mackintoshes and
      umbrellas, form his equipment. He is accompanied by a band of workers.
      Their rules are to be up for prayer-meeting at seven in the morning, and
      "never to look at any race, or jockey, or horse." This is a precaution
      against the Old Adam. It saves the Mission from going over to the enemy on
      the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nix gives an account of his performance in the <i>Methodist Times</i>.
      He converted a lot of people. So has Hugh Price Hughes. "At one time," he
      says, "there were three Church of England clergymen and their wives and
      some distinguished members of the aristocracy in the tent"&mdash;probably
      out of the wet. Of course <i>they</i> were not converted. But what a pity!
      A "converted clergyman" would have been a glorious catch, worth five
      thousand pounds at St. James's Hall. And fancy bagging a duke! It was
      enough to make Mr. Nix's mouth water. He must have felt some of the agony
      of Tantalus. He was up to the neck, so to speak, in lords and parsons, and
      could not grasp one. Dissenting ministers and their wives did not show up.
      Naturally. They would not go to such a naughty place&mdash;except in a
      mission van. Mr. Nix has a keen eye for the Methodist business. He has
      open and sly digs at the Church clergy. One of the tipsters said his
      father was a clergyman, but "his religion was no good to him." He would
      give anything for the religion of "the little chap that stood on the
      stool." That was Mr. Nix.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suspect the Epsom races will outlast Mr. Nix. There is more boast than
      performance about Missions. Christianity is always converting drunkards,
      profligates, prostitutes, and thieves; but somehow our social evils do not
      disappear. Even the drink bill runs up, despite all the Gospel pledges. <i>Nix</i>
      is the practical result of the efforts of gentlemen like Mr. Nix. They are
      on the wrong tack. They are sweeping back the tide with mops. The real
      reformatory agency is the spread of education and refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the mission will go on. It is a good advertisement. Mr. Hughes gives
      it a special leading article. He cries up the Epsom mob as the "most
      representative gathering of Englishmen," and "therefore a fair specimen of
      the mental and moral condition of the English people." This is stuff and
      nonsense, but it serves its purpose. Mr. Hughes wants to show that
      Missions are needed. He finds that "the great majority of the people are
      outside the Christian Church," that "this is still a heathen country."
      Perhaps so. But what a confession after all these centuries of
      gospel-grinding and Church predominance! There are fifty or sixty thousand
      churches and chapels, and as many sky-pilots. Six million children go to
      Sunday-school. The Bible is forced into the public day-schools. Copies are
      circulated by the million. Twenty millions a year, at the least, is spent
      in inculcating Christianity. Yet England is still "a heathen country."
      Well, if this be the case, what is the use of Mr. Nix? What is the use of
      Mr. Hughes? Greater preachers have gone before them and have failed. Is it
      not high time for Jesus to run the job himself? "Come, Lord Jesus," as
      John says. Let him descend from the Father's right hand and take Mr. Nix's
      place at the next Derby. He might even convert the "clergymen and their
      wives" and the "distinguished members of the aristocracy." Anyhow he
      should try. He will not be crucified again. The worst that could happen is
      a charge of obstruction, and perhaps a fine of forty shillings. But surely
      he will not lay himself open to such indignities. He should triumphantly
      assert his deity. A few big miracles would strike Englishmen more than the
      Jews, who were sated with the supernatural. He might stop the horses in
      mid career, fix the jockeys in their saddles, root the Epsom mob where
      they stood, and address them from the top of the grand stand. That would
      settle them. They would all go to church next Sunday. Yes, Jesus must come
      himself, or the case is hopeless. Missions to the people of this "heathen
      country" are like fleas on an elephant. What the ministers should pray for
      is the second coming of Christ. But we guess it will be a long time before
      they sing "Lo, he comes, in clouds descending." Besides, it would be a bad
      job for <i>them</i>. Their occupation would be gone. A wholesale
      conversion would cut up the retail traders. On the whole, we have no doubt
      the men of God prefer the good old plan. If Jesus came he would take the
      bread out of their mouths. That would be shabby-after they had devoted
      themselves to the business. The very publicans demand compensation, and
      could the sky-pilots do less? But perhaps Jesus would send them all <i>home</i>.
      We should like to see them go. It would give the world a chance.

    <h2>
      ATHEIST MURDERERS. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * January, 1894.
</pre>
    <p>
      An Open Letter to the Bishop of Winchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop,&mdash;You are a high and well-paid dignitary of the Church of
      England. You are therefore a State official, as much as a soldier or a
      policeman; and, as such, you are amenable to public criticism. It is
      possible that you never heard of me before, but I am a member of the
      English public, and as a citizen I help (very unwillingly) to support the
      Church, and therefore to support <i>you</i>. My right to address you is
      thus indisputable. I make no apology or excuse for doing so; and, as for
      my reason, it will appear in the course of this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I notice in the daily and weekly newspapers a paragraph which concerns you&mdash;<i>and
      me</i>. The paragraph is exactly the same in all the papers I have seen;
      it must therefore have emanated from, and been circulated by, one hand;
      and that hand I suspect is yours, particularly as it insinuates the
      necessity of supporting Christian Missions in England&mdash;that is, of
      subscribing to Church agencies over and above the nine or ten millions a
      year which your Establishment spends (or devours) in ministering to what
      you call "the spiritual needs" of the English people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paragraph I refer to states that you have converted and confirmed an
      Atheist, and that this Atheist has been hung for the crime of murder; and
      it plainly hints that his crime was the natural result of his irreligious
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you make so much of this case, I presume that this murderer&mdash;who
      was not good enough to live on earth, and whom you have sent to live for
      ever in heaven&mdash;is the only Atheist you have ever converted; so that
      in every way the case is one of exceptional interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, before I go any farther, let me tell you why the case concerns me
      as well as you. I am an Atheist, and a teacher of Atheism. I am the
      President of the National Secular Society, which is the only open
      organisation of Freethinkers in England. My immediate predecessor in this
      office was Charles Bradlaugh, of whom you <i>must</i> have heard. Not to
      know him would argue yourself unknown. My personality is not so famous as
      his, but my office is the same, and you will now understand why I address
      you on the subject of your converted murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper paragraph to which I have referred is brief and inadequate,
      but fuller particulars are given in your <i>Diocesan Chronicle</i>, for a
      copy of which I am indebted to the kindness of a gentleman who is
      technically a member of your flock. He is a Freethinker, but I do not
      believe you will convert him, and still less that you will ever "assist"
      at his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderer for whom you made the gallows the gateway to heaven was
      called George Mason. He was nineteen years of age. Serving in the militia,
      he was liable to severe discipline. His sergeant had him imprisoned for
      three days, and in revenge he shot the officer dead while at rifle
      practice. It is an obvious moral, which I wonder your lordship does not
      perceive, that it is dangerous to put deadly weapons in the hands of
      passionate boys. Your lordship's interest in the case seems to be entirely
      <i>professional</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this lad was simply a militiaman your lordship would not have
      regarded him as an object of solicitude. As a convicted murderer, he
      became profoundly interesting. No less than three clergymen took him in
      hand: the Rev. J. L. Ladbrooke, the Rev. James Baker, and yourself. Three
      to one are long odds, and it is no marvel that you conquered the boy.
      Still, it is unfortunate that we have only <i>your</i> account of the
      conflict, for your profession is not famous for what I will politely call
      <i>accuracy</i>. Herder remarked that "Christian veracity" deserved to
      rank with "Punic faith." How many falsehoods has your Church circulated
      about <i>great</i> Freethinkers! Why should it hesitate, then, to tell
      untruths about <i>little</i> ones? A Wesleyan minister, the Rev. Hugh
      Price Hughes, has published a long circumstantial story of a converted
      Atheist shoemaker, which is proved to be false in all its main features.
      It is far from certain, therefore, that your lordship's account of the
      conversion of George Mason is true. You and your two clerical colleagues
      can say what you please; your evidence cannot be tested; and <i>such</i>
      evidence, especially when given by persons who are confederates in a
      common cause, is always open to suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I need not doubt that George Mason made an edifying end. It
      is the way of murderers. What I venture to doubt is your statement as to
      his life. You write as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "His early life was lived in the east of London, his trade being that of a
      costermonger, and he was brought up by his father, a professed atheist,
      who was in the habit of reading the Bible with this boy and a company of
      other freethinkers, verse by verse, and deliberately turning it into
      ridicule, by way of commentary. It is hard to imagine a more deliberate
      training for the gallows than what his father gave him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, you say the boy was "insignificant, almost stunted to look at,"
      and you add that "his only opportunity was to learn how to be a child of
      the Devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I wish to observe, in the first place, that you have not said <i>enough</i>.
      You do not say whether George Mason's father is still living. I have not
      been able to hear of him myself. If he be still living, have you taken the
      trouble to obtain <i>his</i> version of the matter? And if not, do you
      think it kind or just to speak of him in this manner? Nor do you say what
      religion George Mason professed in the Militia, whether he attended
      "divine service," and what was its influence upon him. You were in too
      great a hurry to capture your Atheist, and insult all who do not believe
      the dogmas of your Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      You regard it as "deliberate training for the gallows" to let a boy laugh
      at the Bible. Has it ever occurred to you to inquire how it is that the
      Bible is so easy to ridicule? Have you ever reflected that what is laughed
      at is generally ridiculous? Are you not aware that the most risible imp
      could hardly laugh at <i>all</i> the contents of the Bible? Who laughs at
      the saying, "Blessed are the peacemakers"? Who laughs at the horrid
      massacres of the Old Testament? But who does <i>not</i> laugh at
      cock-and-bull stories like that of Jonah and the whale? Your lordship does
      not discriminate. Very little thought would show you that some parts of
      the Bible <i>cannot</i> be laughed at, that where it <i>can</i> be laughed
      at it is probably absurd, and that to laugh at an absurdity is certainly
      no "training for the gallows."
    </p>
    <p>
      Your lordship evidently wishes to convey the idea that Atheists are very
      likely to become murderers, or <i>more</i> likely than their Christian
      fellow citizens. This I deny, and I ask for your evidence. All you adduce
      is the case of this "insignificant" and "stunted" boy. Let us suppose for
      a moment that your statement about him is entirely accurate. What does it
      prove? Simply this, that it is not impossible for an Atheist to commit a
      murder. But who ever said it was? Who asserts that Atheists are absolutely
      free from the passions and frailties of human nature? Has your lordship
      never heard of a Christian murderer? Is it not a fact that Jesus Christ
      himself could not select his apostles without including a villain? "Twelve
      of you have I chosen," he said, "and one of you is a murderer." Is not one
      in twelve a large percentage? Why, then, is the world to be alarmed, and
      invited to subscribe to Christian Missions, because one Atheist out of all
      the thousands in England commits a murder &mdash;and that one an
      "insignificant" and "stunted" boy, apparently bred in poverty and
      hardship?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind you, I am not admitting that George Mason <i>was</i> an Atheist, or
      the <i>son</i> of an Atheist. I say that has to be proved. I am taking
      your lordship's account of the matter as true merely for the sake of
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me draw your attention to some <i>facts</i>. So many of the clergy in
      your own Church "went wrong" that you were compelled to obtain a special
      Act of Parliament to enable you to get rid of them. Is it not true, also,
      that the greatest swindlers of this age have been extremely pious? What do
      you make of Messrs Hobbs and Wright? What do you think of Jabez Balfour?
      Are not such scoundrels a thousand times worse than a passionate boy like
      George Mason? Were not the "Liberator" victims fleeced and ruined by
      professed Christians? What have you to say about Mr. Hastings, Captain
      Verney, and Mr. De Cobain, who were all convicted of bad crimes and
      expelled from Parliament? Have you ever heard of the text, "Physician heal
      thyself"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another fact. A few months ago an Irish clergyman, the Rev. George
      Griffiths, deliberately shot his own mother for the sake of what cash he
      could find in her desk. He was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be
      hung. Would you think me justified in saying that the Rev. George
      Griffiths committed a murder because he was a Christian? Why, then, do you
      pretend that George Mason committed a murder because he or his father was
      an Atheist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lay your hand upon your heart, and answer this question honestly. Do you
      really believe that an Atheist has a special proclivity to murder? What is
      there in Atheism to make men hate each other? When a man holds the hand of
      the woman he loves, or feels about his neck the little arms of his child,
      do you suppose he is likely to injure either of them because he is unable
      to accept your dogma about the mystery of this illimitable universe? Shall
      I hate my own boy because I disbelieve that Jesus Christ was born without
      a father? Shall I keep him without food and clothes because I see no proof
      of a special providence? Will Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> poison my mind
      because I think it finer than the gospels? If I treat the Creation Story
      and the Deluge as legend and mythology, and smile at the feats of Samson,
      shall I therefore commit a burglary? If I think that my neighbor's life in
      this world is <i>his all</i>, that death ends his possibilities, do you
      really think I shall be the more likely to rob him of what I can never
      restore?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am at a loss to understand your lordship, and I invite you to explain
      yourself. At present I can only see in your account of George Mason, a
      very common exhibition of Christian logic, and Christian temper. Your
      lordship's is not the charity that "thinketh no evil." You ascribe
      wickedness to those who differ from you in opinion. I conceive it possible
      for men to differ from you in religion, and yet to equal you in morality.
      I conceive it even possible that some of them might surpass you without a
      miracle.

    <h2>
      A RELIGION FOR EUNUCHS. *
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * June, 1890.
</pre>
    <p>
      This is a strong title, and it requires a justification. We have to plead
      that nothing else would serve our purpose. But is our purpose a sound one?
      That will appear in the course of this article. Let the reader finish what
      we have to say before he forms a judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We purpose to criticise the view of Christianity recently put forth by the
      greatest writer in Russia. Count Leo Tolstoi enjoys an European fame. He
      is one of the classics of modern fiction. His work in imaginative
      literature, as well as his work in religion, said the late Matthew Arnold,
      is "more than sufficient to signalise him as one of the most marking,
      interesting, and sympathy-inspiring men of our time." Whatever such a man
      writes deserves the closest attention. Not, indeed, that this needs to be
      bespoken for him. He has the qualities that compel it. There is the stamp
      of power on all his productions. We pause at them involuntarily, as we
      turn to look at a physical king of men who passes us in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years Count Tolstoi discontinued his work as a novelist. His mind
      became occupied with social and religious problems. He ceased to be a man
      of the world and became a Christian; and his being a most sincere nature,
      endowed with a certain large simplicity which is characteristic of the
      Russian mind, he did not rest in ecclesiastical Christianity. He embraced
      the religion of Christ, and began working it out to legitimate issues. To
      him the Sermon on the Mount is divine teaching, not in a metaphorical
      sense, but in its literal significance. Accordingly he tells the Christian
      world, in such volumes as <i>My Religion</i> and <i>My Confession</i>,
      that it is all astray from the religion of Christ. He points to what its
      Savior said, takes his words in their honest meaning, and brands as
      un-Christian the whole framework of Christian society, with its armies,
      its police, its law courts, its wealth, and its institution of property.
      The Bishop of Peterborough and Count Tolstoi are at one in believing that
      if the Sermon on the Mount were carried out the State would go to ruin;
      only the Bishop of Peterborough shrinks from this, and jesuitically
      narrows the scope of Christ's teaching, while Count Tolstoi accepts it
      loyally and calls on Christians to square their practice with their
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabeau said of Robespierre, "He is in earnest, he will go far." This is
      what we felt with respect to Count Tolstoi. Sooner or later he was certain
      to follow Jesus to the bitter end. After property comes the institution of
      marriage, upon which the teaching of Jesus may be found in the gospels.
      Count Tolstoi now insists on this teaching being practised. He has written
      a novel, <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i>, to show the evils, not only of
      marriage, but of all sexual relations. Since then he has written a sober
      article to justify the sentiments of the hero, or the protagonist, of that
      terrible story. It is no longer possible to say that Pozdnischeff's ideas
      are those of a person in a drama. Count Tolstoi accepts the full
      responsibility of them, and presses them still further. He is now the
      un-blenching apostle of real Christianity&mdash;not the Christianity of
      the Churches, but the Christianity of Christ; and his new evangel will
      alarm the growing army of "advanced Christians," who are always canting,
      in their sentimental way, the very phrase which he develops in all its
      terrific meaning. To be a Christian, he tells them, is to crucify the
      body, to kill the animal passions, to live the pure life of the spirit,
      and, in short, to practise every austerity of asceticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tolstoi did not jump to this conclusion. Writing on his novels, Mr. W. E.
      Henley called him "the great optimist." The <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> is the
      work of a profound pessimist. Concluding <i>What To Do</i>, Tolstoi wrote
      a noble passage on the sacredness of motherhood. Now all that is changed.
      Motherhood must go too. It will take time, for the old Adam is strong in
      us. But go it must, and when we have all brought our bodies under, no more
      children will be born. The race will expire, having perfected its
      imitation of Christ, and the animals that remain will hold the world in
      undisputed possession; unless, indeed, they catch the contagion, and wind
      up the whole terrestrial business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we treat Tolstoi's evangel in detail we must remark that he does
      not explain the "primeval command" of Jehovah to Adam and Eve&mdash;"Be ye
      fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth." This is very inconsistent
      with the gospel of absolute chastity. Jehovah says, "Get as many children
      as you can." Christ says, "Get none at all." If it was the same God who
      gave both orders he changed his mind completely, and having changed it
      once he may change it again. In that case the Koran will succeed the New
      Testament, and the <i>Imitation of Christ</i> give place to the <i>Arabian
      Nights</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Revenons a nos moutons</i>. The <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> is a terrible
      story, but like all novels with a purpose, it is inartistic. Othello kills
      Desdemona without moralising on the sinfulness of marriage, and
      Pozdnischeff stabs his wife from sheer jealousy. All the preaching is by
      the way. It might be cut out without affecting the work, and that is its
      condemnation. When the preacher steps forward the artist retires. And as
      we are dealing with Tolstoi the preacher we shall go straight to his
      article in the <i>Universal Review</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tolstoi admits that what he now teaches is incompatible with what he
      taught before. When writing the <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i>, he says: "I had
      not the faintest presentiment that the train of thought I had started
      would lead me whither it did. I was terrified by my own conclusion, and
      was at first disposed to reject it; but it was impossible not to hearken
      to the voice of my reason and my conscience." This is the language of
      earnest sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion is this&mdash;"Even to contract marriage is, from a
      Christian point of view, not a progress but a fall. Love and all the
      states that accompany and follow it, however we may try in prose and verse
      to prove the contrary, never do and never can facilitate the attainment of
      an aim worthy of men, but always make it more difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is sufficiently dogmatic. Chapman thought otherwise.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    Without love
     All beauties bred in women are in vain,
     All virtues born in men lie buried;
     For love informs them as the sun doth colors:
     And as the sun, reflecting his warm beams
     Against the earth, begets all fruits and flowers,
     So love, fair shining in the inward man,
     Brings forth in him the honorable fruits
     Of valor, wit, virtue, and haughty thoughts,
     Brave resolution and divine discourse.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus the great Elizabethan. Now for the laureate of the Victorian age.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     For indeed I knew Of no more subtle master under heaven
     Than is the maiden passion for a maid,
     Not only to keep down the base in man,
     But teach high thought, and amiable words
     And courtliness, and the desire of fame,
     And love of truth, and all that makes a man.
</pre>
    <p>
      Chapman's strain is higher than Tennyson's, but they harmonise. Tolstoi's
      is a harsher note. He vilifies the flesh to exalt the spirit, as though
      the two never mingled. He would abolish the springs of life to purify its
      stream! He bids us see in our passions "foes to be conquered rather than
      friends to be encouraged." Why not try to establish a just harmony between
      them? Is there no medium? Must the passions be kings or slaves, in prison
      or on the throne? "It is thought an injury to reason," wrote Diderot, "to
      say a word in favor of her rivals; yet it is only the passions, and strong
      passions, that can lift the soul to great things; without them there is
      nothing sublime, whether in conduct or in productions&mdash;art becomes
      childish and virtue trivial."
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us hear Tolstoi simply as a follower of Christ. We cannot do
      better than reproduce some of his sentences <i>in extenso</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christ not only never instituted marriage, but, if we search for formal
      precept on the subject, we find that he rather disapproved it than
      otherwise. ('And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
      sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my
      name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting
      life.' Matthew xix. 29, Mark z. 29, 30, Luke xviii. 29,30). He only
      impressed upon married and unmarried alike the necessity of striving after
      perfection, which includes chastity in marriage and out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian marriage....
      This is what was always taught and believed by true Christians of the
      first and following centuries.... In the eyes of a Christian, sexual
      relations in marriage not only do not constitute a lawful, right, and
      happy state, as our society and our churches maintain, but, on the
      contrary, are always a fall, a weakness, a sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a thing as Christian marriage never was and never could be. Christ
      did not marry, nor did he establish marriage; neither did his disciples
      marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Christian, I say, cannot view sexual intercourse otherwise than as a
      deviation from the doctrine of Christ&mdash;as a sin. This is clearly laid
      down in Matt. v. 28, and the ceremony called Christian marriage does not
      alter its character one jot. A Christian will never, therefore, desire
      marriage, but will always avoid it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the Gospel it is laid down so clearly as to make it impossible to
      explain it away, that he who is already married when he discovers and
      accepts the truth, must abide with her with whom he has been living, i.e.,
      must not change his wife, and must live more chastely than before (Matt.
      v. 32, xix. 8-12), that he who is single should remain unmarried and
      continue to live chastely (Matt. xix. 10, 12), and that both the one and
      the other, in their yearning and striving after perfect chastity, are
      guilty of sin if they look on a woman as an object of pleasure (Matt. v.
      28, 29)."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pozdnischeff, at the close of the <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i>, clinches all
      this by saying&mdash;"People should understand the true significance of
      the words of St. Matthew as to looking upon a woman with the eye of
      desire; for the words apply to woman in her sisterly character&mdash;not
      only to another man's wife, but also, and above all, to one's own."
    </p>
    <p>
      If this view of marriage prevailed, and perfect chastity obtained, the
      human race would come to an end. Tolstoi says he cannot help that. Carnal
      love perpetuates the race, and spiritual love will extinguish it. But what
      if it does? It is a familiar religious dogma that the world will have an
      end, and science tells us that the sun is losing its heat, the result of
      which must in time be the extinction of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Russian does not shrink from the logic of Christ's teaching. He
      follows Christ as St Paul did; as St. Peter did, who forsook his wife; as
      the Fathers did in crying up virginity and running down marriage; as the
      monks and nuns did who severed themselves from the world and the flesh,
      though they often fell into the hands of the Devil. Still there is another
      step for Count Tolstoi to take. He has not pressed one important saying of
      Christ, and it is this&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For there are some eunuchs, which were born so from their mother's womb:
      and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be
      eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
      sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it" (Matt. xix. 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Origen followed this advice and emasculated himself. Nor was he
      alone in the practice. All the disciples of his contemporary, Valens of
      Barathis, made themselves eunuchs. Mantegazza considers them the spiritual
      fathers of the Skopskis, a Russian sect dating from the eleventh century.
      They have been persecuted, but they number nearly six thousand, and regard
      themselves as the real Christians, the only true followers of Christ. They
      castrate themselves, and sometimes amputate the genitals entirely; the
      women even mutilate their breasts as a mark of their sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will Count Tolstoi take the final step? It seems logically necessary even
      without the text on eunuchs, for the only certain way to avoid sexual
      intercourse is to make it impossible. In any case we are very much obliged
      to him for holding up the <i>real</i> Christianity, as far as he sees it,
      to the purblind and hypocritical mob of professed Christians. It will
      fortify Freethinkers in their scepticism, and warn the healthy manhood and
      womanhood of Europe against this oriental asceticism which pretends to be
      a divine message to the robust Occident. When Tolstoi goes the one step
      farther, and embraces the teaching of Jesus in its entirety, he will be
      the most powerful enemy of Christianity in the world. By demonstrating it
      to be a religion for eunuchs he will array against it the deepest
      instincts of mankind.

      Most of our readers will recollect the controversy that was carried on,
      more than twelve months ago, in the columns of the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.
      Mr. Robert Buchanan had published his new poem, "The Wandering Jew," in
      which Jesus Christ was depicted as a forlorn vagrant, sick of the evil and
      infamy wrought in his name, and for which he was historically though not
      intentionally responsible. This poem was reviewed by Mr. Richard Le
      Gallienne, a younger poet, who is also a professional critic in the <i>Star</i>,
      where his weekly <i>causerie</i> on books and their writers is printed
      over the signature of "Logroller." Mr. Le Gallienne took Mr. Buchanan to
      task for his hostility to "the Christianity of Christ," the nature of
      which was not defined nor even made intelligible. Mr. Buchanan replied
      with his usual impetuosity, declining to have anything to do with
      Christianity except in the way of opposition, and laughing at the
      sentimental dilution which his young friend was attempting to pass off as
      the original, unadulterated article. Mr. Le Gallienne retorted with
      youthful self-confidence that Mr. Buchanan did not understand
      Christianity. Other writers then joined in the fray, and the result was
      the famous "Is Christianity Played Out?" discussion in the <i>Chronicle</i>.
      It was kept going for a week or two, until parliament met and Jesus Christ
      had to make way for William Ewart Gladstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne hinted that he was preparing a kind of manifesto on the
      subject of Christianity. The world was to be informed at length as to the
      "essential" nature of that religion. Divines and Freethinkers had alike
      misunderstood and misrepresented it. After a lapse of nearly two thousand
      years the "straight tip," if we may so express it, was to come from
      "Logroller." He would soon speak and set the weary world at rest with the
      triumphant proclamation of the real, imperishable religion of Jesus
      Christ. Presently it was announced, in judicious puffs, that the manifesto
      was growing under Mr. Le Gallienne's hands. It would take the form of a
      book, to be entitled <i>The Religion of a Literary Man</i>. The title had
      little relation to the Galilean carpenter or his fishing disciples. Nor
      was it in any sense happy. It smacked too much of the "shop." Sir Thomas
      Browne, it is true, wrote a "Religio Medici," and gave a physician's view
      of religion; but he was a man of rare genius as well as quaintness, and
      allowance was to be made for his idiosyncrasy. Besides, there is a certain
      speciality in a doctor's way of looking at religion, if he compares his
      knowledge with his faith. But what is the speciality of a literary man on
      this particular subject? Other trades and professions might as well follow
      suit, and give us "The Religion of a Porkbutcher," or "The Faith of a
      Farmer," or "The Creed of a Constable." Even the "Belief of a Barman" is
      not beyond the scope of a rational probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne's long-promised evangel "burst upon the town" a month
      ago. The "Religio Scriptoris"&mdash;which a puzzler at Latin might render
      as "The Religion of a Scribbler"&mdash;made a dainty appearance. The
      title-page was in two colors, with a pretty arabesque border. The type
      throughout was neatly leaded, with a column for summaries in the old
      fashion, and a wide margin of imitation hand-made paper. The book was
      pretty, like the writing, and opposite the title-page was a pretty verse:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'The old gods pass'&mdash;the cry goes round,
     'Lo! how their temples strew the ground';
     Nor mark we where, on new-fledged wings,
     Faith, like the phoenix, soars and sings.
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, it is <i>all</i> pretty. There is an air of dilettanteism about the
      whole production. It will probably be grateful to the sentimentalists who,
      despite their scepticism, still cling to the name of Christian; but we
      imagine it will rather irritate than satisfy other readers of more
      strenuous and scrupulous intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is dedicated to "A. E. Fletcher, Esq.," editor of the <i>Daily
      Chronicle</i>, who may well be proud (not of this dedication, but) of the
      high position to which he has raised that organ of Radical principles. Mr.
      Le Gallienne refers to the old controversy in the <i>Chronicle</i> as
      "raising an important question&mdash;to me the most important of questions&mdash;as
      to whether Christianity was really so obsolete to-day as its opponents
      glibly assume." "I could not stand by," he continues, "and see the sublime
      figure of Christ vulgarised to make an Adelphi holiday." For this reason,
      he modestly says, he "ventured to play David to Mr. Buchanan's
      Philistine." Mr. Fletcher allowed him a battlefield and "thence sprung [he
      means <i>sprang</i>] the following pages." Thus much for the origin of the
      work, and now for its character. "I have condensed in its pages," the
      writer says, "much religious experience, and long and ardent thought on
      spiritual matters." No doubt he believes this statement, but is it true?
      Is not the writer too young to have had "much experience"? and where are
      the traces of the "long and ardent thought"? Mr. Le Gallienne might reply
      that his thought <i>has</i> been long and ardent, whatever the value of
      the result; but, in that case, he is not cut out for a thinker; and,
      indeed, he seems aware of the fact, for he often prints "thinker" in
      inverted commas to show his disdain of the article. His "one cure" for
      "modern doubt" is to "think less and feel more," and some may be tempted
      to remark that he has certainly followed the first part of the
      prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne is a long time in coming to "the sublime figure of
      Christ." He has a considerable ground to cover before he undertakes the
      cleaning and painting of the old idol. First of all, he has to establish
      his native superiority over the common herd. He divides the world into
      "natural spiritualists and materialists." The first have a Spiritual Sense
      (capitals, please), while the second have not; and "it is obvious that the
      large majority of mankind belong to the latter class." Mr. Le Gallienne,
      of course, belongs to the former. He is a member of Nature's (or God's)
      aristocracy. It is for them that he writes, although on his own
      supposition the task is superfluous. The common herd of materialists are
      warned against wasting their time in reading him&mdash;which also is
      somewhat superfluous. The fault of materialists&mdash;or rather their
      misfortune, for they are born that way&mdash;is that they are such
      sticklers for facts, and have "no conception of aught they cannot touch
      and handle, eat, or see through a microscope." Not, indeed, that Mr. Le
      Gallienne objects to eating, for instance; he speaks of it with wet lips,
      and looks down upon the Vegetarian as a person whose "spiritual insight"
      is not "mercifully intermittent," especially at meal times. But barring
      meal times, and other fleshly occasions when the spiritualists join the
      materialists, the former habitually see facts as "transitory symbols" of
      "transfiguring mysteries," so that the whole world (and perhaps the moon)
      is "palpitating with occult significance."
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance. A materialist eats rook-pie, and cares for nothing else but
      a sound digestion. The spiritualist also eats rook-pie, but after the
      repast he will sentimentalise over dead rooks, without losing his belief
      in an all-merciful Providence. He will assure you, indeed, and try to
      convince you, that the shooting of rooks and the pulling off their heads
      to prevent the rook-pie from tasting bitter, is simply one of the
      "terrible and beautiful mysteries" which make the world so interesting&mdash;especially
      to gentlemen of comprehensive natures, who combine a taste for rook-pie
      with a taste for optimistic theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we come to test Mr. Le Gallienne's conception of mystery, we find it
      to be nothing but muddle. The whole mystery of life, he says, may be found
      in a curve: as thus, Why isn't it straight?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Color in itself is a mystery, and are there not trance-like moments when
      suddenly we ask ourselves, why a <i>colored</i> world, why a <i>blue</i>
      sky, and <i>green</i> grass, why not <i>vice versa</i>, or why any color
      at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne is evidently prepared to stand aghast at the fact that
      twice two make four. Why <i>always</i> four? Why not three to-day and
      seven to-morrow? Yea, and echo answers, Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another illustration of "mystery"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Science can tell us that oxygen and hydrogen will unite under certain
      conditions to produce water, but it cannot tell us why they do so; the
      mystery of their affinity is as dark as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne has a whole chapter on the Relative Spirit, yet his "long
      and ardent thought" does not enable him to see that he is himself a slave
      of metaphysics. All this "mystery" is nothing but the "meat-roasting power
      of the meat-jack." He question of <i>why</i> oxygen and hydrogen form
      water is a prompting of anthropomorphism. Intellectually, it is simply
      childish. It could only be put by one who has <i>not</i> grasped the great
      doctrine of the Relativity of Knowledge. Man can no more get beyond his
      own knowledge&mdash;which is and ever must be finite&mdash;than he can get
      outside himself, or run away from his own shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sacred mystery of motherhood," of which Mr. Le Gallienne speaks, is a
      pretty expression. It may pass in the realm of poetry, with the
      "everlasting hills" and the "eternal sea," which are but transient
      phenomena in the infinite existence of the universe. The "mystery" of
      human motherhood is no greater than the "mystery" of any other form of
      reproduction, while its "sacredness" depends on circumstances; the term,
      in short, being a compendium of a great variety of personal and social
      feelings, which may or may not be present in any particular case. What
      becomes of the "sacred mystery of motherhood" when a poor servant girl
      brings her child into the world unaided, and casts it into the Thames?
      What becomes of it when violation takes the place of seduction, and a
      woman bears a child to a man she loathes and hates?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mystery," like other words we inherit from the theological and
      metaphysical stages, is only fit for use in poetry; it is out of place in
      science or philosophy; and we advise Mr. Le Gallienne to get a
      comprehension of this truth before he takes fresh excursions in the "realm
      of long and ardent thought." The subjective ideas of poetry cease to be
      admirable and stimulating when they are projected into the external world,
      and become our masters instead of our servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne follows the beaten track of theology in talking about
      "mysteries," which are only subterfuges to cover the retreat of a
      nonplussed debater, or a warren for the fugitive game of the hounds of
      reason. He also follows the beaten track in arguing&mdash;or rather
      assuming&mdash;that the elect spiritualists have a "sense" which is
      lacking in the reprobate materialists. There is nothing like a good
      lumping assumption for begging the question at issue. It settles the
      discussion before it opens, and saves a world of trouble. But even an
      assumption may be looked in the face; nay, it is best looked in the face
      when you suspect it of being an imposture.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Mr. Le Gallienne, the religious sense&mdash;or, as he also
      writes it, the SPIRITUAL SENSE, with capital letters&mdash;is not after
      all a special faculty, but a special compound, or interaction, of common
      faculties. He does, indeed, treat these common faculties as "tribautaries"
      of the Spiritual Sense; but it is very evident that the tributaries make
      the stream, which is merely a name without them. First, there is the Sense
      of Wonder, which is nothing but the positive side of ignorance; second,
      the Sense of Beauty, which "is not necessarily a religious sense," but may
      be pressed into its service; third, the Sense of Pity, which really
      originates, as we conceive, in parental affection, and has even been
      noticed in rats as well as in religionists; fourth, the Sense of Humor,
      which is a peculiarly "candid" friend of religion, so that Mr. Le
      Gallienne is obliged to give its devotees an impressive warning against
      running into Ill-nature and Sacrilege; fifth, the Sense of Gratitude,
      which in religion, so far as we can see, appears to consist in a lively
      sense of favors to come, through the medium of prayer, to which
      thanksgiving is only a judicious preliminary, like the compliments and
      flatteries that are addressed to an oriental despot by his humble but
      calculating petitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all these senses are perfectly natural. Every one of them is found in
      the lower animals as well as in man. How then can there be anything
      supernatural, supersensible, or "spiritual,", in their combination? Is it
      not evident that Religion works, like everything else, upon common
      materials? Chiefly, indeed, upon the unchastened imagination of credulous
      ignorance. We may prove this from Mr. Le Gallienne's own testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there not impressions borne in upon the soul of man as he stands a
      spectator of the universe which religion alone attempts to formulate?
      Certain impressions are expressed by the sciences and the arts. 'How
      wonderful!'&mdash;exclaims man, and that is the dawn of science; 'How
      beautiful!'&mdash;and that is the dawn of art. But there is a still
      higher, a more solemn, impression borne in upon him, and, falling upon his
      knees, he cries, 'How holy!' That is the dawn of religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne does not see that this is all imagination. "The heavens
      declare the glory of God," exclaims the Psalmist. On the other hand, a
      great French Atheist exclaimed, "The heavens declare the glory of
      Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne does not see, either, that man did not exclaim, "How
      holy!" when he first fell upon his knees. His feeling was rather, "How
      terrible!" The sense of holiness is a social product&mdash;a high
      sublimation of morality. Man had to possess it himself, and see it highly
      exemplified in picked specimens of his kind, before he bestowed it upon
      his gods. Deities do not anticipate, they follow, the course of human
      evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne is an Optimist. He is young and prosperous, and, judging
      from his poetry, happily married. He is therefore satisfied that all is
      for the best&mdash;if properly understood; just as when an alderman has
      dined, all the world is happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are such people, however, as Pessimists, and Mr. Le Gallienne hates
      them. Schopenhauer, for instance, he rails at as a "small philosopher."
      whose ideas were only the "formulation of his own special disease, the
      expression of his own ineffably petty and uncomfortable disposition." At
      which one can only stare, as at a mannikin attacking a colossus. Spinoza
      too can be treated jauntily if he does not fall into line with Mr. Le
      Gallienne. George Meredith is treated with abundant respect, but he is
      wronged by being enrolled as a facile optimist, and "the strongest of the
      apostles of faith." He is certainly nothing of the kind, in Mr. Le
      Gallienne's sense of the words. He has faith in reason and humanity, but
      this is a very different thing from faith in the idols&mdash;even the
      greatest idol&mdash;of the Pantheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is too much pain in the world," said Charles Darwin, who knew what
      he was talking about, and always expressed himself with moderation. In the
      moral world, pain becomes evil; and the problem of evil has ever been the
      crux of Theism. It cannot be solved on Theistic grounds, and accordingly
      it has to be explained away. Pain, we are told, is the great agent in our
      development; in the ethical sphere, it is the "purifying fire," which
      purges the gold in us from its dross. All of which sounds very pretty in a
      lecture, and looks very pretty in a book; but is apt to excite disgust
      when a man is suffering from incurable cancer, or utter destitution in the
      midst of plenty; or when a mother stands over the corpse of her child,
      mangled in some terrible accident, or burnt to a cinder in a fatal fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, pain subserves a partial purpose. It is sometimes a warning,
      though the warning is often too late. But its function is immensely
      overrated by Mr. Le Gallienne and other religionists. It is all very well
      to talk about the "crucible," but half the people who go into it are
      reduced to ashes. Mr. Le Gallienne will not accept Spinoza's view that
      "pain is an unmistakable evil; joy the vitalising, fructifying power." But
      the great mystic, William Blake, said the same thing in, "Joys impregnate,
      sorrows bring forth." George Meredith has expressed the same view in
      saying that "Adversity tests, it does not nourish us." Even the struggle
      for existence does not add any strength to the survivors. It sometimes
      cripples them. By eliminating the unfit&mdash;that is, the weak&mdash;it
      raises the average capacity. But what a method for Infinite Wisdom and
      Infinite Goodness! There was more sense, and less cruelty, in the ancient
      method of infanticide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne seems to feel that his theory of pain is too fantastic,
      so he falls back on "mystery." "We can form no possible conception," he
      says, "of the processes of God." Why then does he talk about them so
      consumedly? Ignorance is a good reason for silence, but none for
      garrulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must be "humble," says Mr. Le Gallienne, and recognise that we only
      exist "to the praise and glory of God." We are his servants and soldiers,
      and the pay is life!&mdash;"Had he willed it, this glorious gift had never
      been ours. We might have still slept on unsentient, unorganised, in the
      trodden dust." Very likely; but who could lose what he never possessed? It
      is a small misfortune that can never be realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne leaps the final difficulty by exclaiming that "Man has no
      rights in regard to God." He shakes hands with St. Paul, who asserts the
      potter's power over the clay. Yes, but man is not clay. He lives and
      feels. He has rights, even against God. The parent is responsible for his
      child, the creator for his creature. The opposite doctrine is fit for
      cowards and slaves. It comes down to us from the old days, when fathers
      had the power of life and death over their children; it dies out as we
      learn that the first claim is the child's, and the first duty the
      parent's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne's god is the old celestial despot of theology in a new
      costume. On the question of a future life, however, we are pleased to find
      a vein of heterodoxy and common sense. Mr. Le Gallienne asks, with respect
      to the "hereafter," whether we "really care about it so much as we
      imagine." We talk about meeting our old friends in heaven, for instance,
      but do we not "meet them again already on earth&mdash;in the new ones"! It
      is said that if fine, cultivated personalities do not survive death, they
      are wasted, and have existed in vain. Mr. Le Gallienne's reply to this
      objection is clear, sufficient, and well expressed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how so? Have they not been in full operation for a lifetime? 'Tis a
      pity truly that the old fiddle should be broken at last; but then for how
      many years has it not been discoursing most excellent music? We naturally
      lament when an old piece of china is some sure day dashed to pieces; but
      then for how long a time has it been delighting and refining those, maybe
      long dead, who have looked upon it.&mdash;If there were no possibility of
      more such fiddles, more such china, their loss would be an infinitely more
      serious matter; but on this the sad-glad old Persian admonishes us:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     .... fear not lest Existence, closing your
     Account and mine, should know the like no more;
     The Eternal Saki from the bowl has pour'd
     Millions of Bubbles like us, and shall pour.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nature ruthlessly tears up her replicas age after age, but she is slow to
      destroy the plates. Her lovely forms are all safely housed in her memory,
      and beauty and goodness sleep secure in her heart, in spite of all the
      arrows of death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without saving what they are, or which of them he considers at all
      convincing, Mr. Le Gallienne observes that the arguments as to a future
      life are "probably stronger on the side of belief"&mdash;which is rather a
      curious expression. But, whichever theory be true, it "does not really
      much matter." Very likely. But how does this fit in with the teaching of
      Christ? If he and his apostles did not believe in the "hereafter," what <i>did</i>
      they believe in? "Great is your reward in heaven," and similar sentences,
      lose all meaning without the doctrine of a future life, about which the
      early Christians were intensely enthusiastic. It was not in <i>this</i>
      world, as Gibbon remarks, that they wished to be happy or useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne argues that Christ taught in parables. He promised
      heaven, and threatened hell, but he spoke in a Pickwickian sense. However
      he used such phrases, it is "certain" that the evangelists "have distorted
      their importance out of all proportion to the rest of his teaching." By
      "certain" we are not to assume that Mr. Le Gallienne has access to occult
      sources of information. We are only to infer that he deals with the
      gospels arbitrarily; accepting them, or rejecting them, as they accord or
      disagree with his preconceptions. Indeed, this is what "essential
      Christianity" must always be. What each picker and chooser likes is
      "essential." What he does not like is unessential, if not a positive
      misrepresentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short and easy is Mr. Le Gallienne's criterion for deciding when Christ is
      literal and when parabolical. "It is only Christ's moral precepts that are
      to be taken literally"&mdash;"all the rest is parable." What a pity it is
      that the Prophet of Nazareth did not give us a clear hint to this effect!
      The theory is one of admirable simplicity. Yet, for all that demure look
      of his, Mr. Le Gallienne is not so admirably simple as to work it out in
      practice. Accepting the moral precepts of Christ literally, a Christian
      should hate his father and mother, take no thought tor the morrow, live in
      poverty to obtain the kingdom of heaven, and turn his left cheek to
      everyone who takes the liberty of striking him on the right. Mr. Le
      Gallienne does not ask us to do these things; he does not say he performs
      them himself, He would probably say, if pressed, that allowance should be
      made for oriental ways of speaking. But, in that case, what becomes of the
      "literal" method of reading the "moral precepts" of Christ?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne, who despises "thinkers," is all at sea in his chapter on
      Essential Christianity. He does not know his own mind. He declares that
      Christ "combined" in his own person and teaching "the intense spirituality
      of the Hebrew, the impassioned self-annihilation of the Hindoo, the joyous
      naturalism of the Greek." Yet he also remarks that there is something
      beautiful in "such presences as Pan, Aphrodite, and Apollo," which we do
      not find in Christianity; though he is careful to add that there is not
      "actually any strife between them and the sadder figure of the Galilean."
      "All the gods of all the creeds," he says, "supplement or corroborate each
      other." Perhaps so; but what becomes of that "masterful synthesis," in
      which Christ gathered up the "joyous naturalism of the Greek," no less
      than other ancient characteristics? It is well to have a good memory (at
      least) when you are setting the world to rights.

      Christianity has been historically a failure. Mr. Le Gallienne more than
      admits the fact; he emphasises it, and tries to explain it. In the first
      place, he says the priests have been too many for Christ; they got hold of
      Christianity, and turned it into the channel of their interests. In the
      next place, the world was not ready for "essential" Christianity; an
      argument in flat contradiction to the doctrine of "preparation," which has
      placed so important a part in Christian apologetics ever since the time of
      Eusebius. In the third place, "essential" Christianity is an idealism, and
      "a throng of idealists is an impossibility." The horde of earthly-minded
      people have simply trodden upon the precious pearls of Christ's teaching.
      It is not true that the world has tried the Gospel of Christ and found it
      wanting; the world has never tried it at all, and "in this nineteenth
      century of the so-called Christian era, it has yet to begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing all this to be true, what does it prove? On the theory that
      Christ was God, or sent by God, it proves either that Providence
      interfered too soon, or that it is incapable of making any real impression
      upon the stubborn inhabitants of this planet; either alternative being a
      reflection on the wisdom or the power of the deity. On the theory that
      Christ was only a man, it proves that he taught an impossible gospel.
      After all these centuries it is still contested and still to be explained.
      Would it not, after all, be better to put aside this source of confusion
      and quarreling, and to rely upon reason and the common sentiments of
      humanity? Mr. Le Gallienne admits that in some respects "such a book as
      Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is more helpful than <i>The New Testament</i>&mdash;for
      it includes more." Why then all this chatter about Christ? Can we ever be
      united on a question of personality? Is it not absurd, and worse than
      absurd, to thrust this object of contention into the arena where the
      forces of light should be fighting, like one man, the strong and
      disciplined forces of darkness?
    </p>
    <p>
      All this talk about "the sublime figure of Christ" is a reminiscence of
      his faded deity. We do not indulge in heated discussions as to the
      personality of any other <i>man</i>. We speak of other "sublime" figures,
      but the expression is one of individual reverence. We do not say that
      those who do not share our opinion of Buddha, Socrates, Mohammed, Bruno,
      Cromwell, Danton, or even Plato or Shakespeare, are grovelling
      materialists and candidates for perdition. No, the chatter about Christ is
      only explicable on the ground that he was, and still is by millions,
      worshipped as a god. The glamor of the deity lingers round the form of the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible for persons of any logical trenchancy to remain in this
      stage. Francis Newman gave up orthodox Christianity, and also the
      equivocations of Unitarianism, but he clung to "the moral perfection of
      Christ." In the course of time, however, the scales fell from his eyes. He
      had been blinded by a false sentiment. Letting his mind play freely upon
      the "sublime figure" of the Prophet of Nazareth, he at length perceived
      that it had its defects. No mortal is endowed with perfection. Such
      monsters do not exist. Indeed, the teaching of Christ is as defective as
      his personality, Its perfection and sufficiency can only be maintained by
      those who never mean to incur the perils of reducing it to practice. Who
      really tries to carry out the Christianity of Christ? Only one man in
      Europe that we know of, and his name is Count Tolstoi; but he is saved
      from the worst consequences of his "idealism" by the more practical wisdom
      of his wife, who will not see him, any more than herself and her children,
      reduced to godly beggary.

      Mr. Le Gallienne seems to us to belong to the sentimentalists, though we
      hope he will grow out of their category. He appears to dread accurate
      thinking, and to imagine that knowledge destroys the charm of nature.
      "Which," he asks, "comes nearest to the truth about love&mdash;poor
      Lombroso's talk about pistil and stamen, or one of Shakespeare's sonnets?"
      The root, he says, is no explanation of the flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be fine, but it is fine nonsense. Lombroso and Shakespeare are
      both right. The physician does not contradict the poet. And if the root is
      no explanation of the flower, what will happen if you are careless about
      the root and the soil in which it is planted? Does a gardener act in that
      way? Is it not the horticulture of Fleet-street sentimentalists?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Le Gallienne is great on what he calls the "root" fallacy. Wishing to
      keep the "irreligious instinct" in mystery, or at least obscurity, he
      objects to anthropological "explanations." He cannot tolerate talk about
      ancestor-worship, and other such "rude beginnings of religion," although
      it comes from the lips of his intellectual superiors, such as Tylor,
      Lubbock, and Spencer. Even if they are right, he falls back upon his old
      exclamation, "What does it matter?" If the flower began as a root, he
      says, that is no argument against "the reality of the flower." But this is
      a shifting of ground. The reality of the flower, the reality of the
      "religious instinct," is not in dispute. The question is, What is its
      explanation? No one denies that man idealises and reveres. The question
      is, How did he come to let these faculties play upon ghosts and gods? And
      the explanation is to be found in his past. It cannot possibly be found in
      his present, unless we take him as a savage, in which case he is an
      embodiment of the past of our own ancestors, from whom we derive every
      vestige of what we call our "religion."

    <p>
      Man's nature, like his destiny, is involved in his origin. However he may
      be developed, he will never be more than "the paragon of animals." And it
      is the recognition of this unchangeable truth which makes all the
      difference between the evolutionist, who labors for rational progress, and
      the sentimentalist, who fritters away his energies in cherishing the
      delusions of faith.
